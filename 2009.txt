Subject: [R-pkgs] Rattle 2.4.0 (Data Mining GUI using R)
Message-ID: <20090104214051.GB25424@kyral.togaware.com>

Version 2.4.0 of Rattle has been released to CRAN.

The rattle package (http://rattle.togaware.com) is a multi platform
(GNU/Linux, Mac/OSX, MS/Windows) GTK based GUI for data mining (for
exploring data and building descriptive and predictive models). It has
undergone a lot of development over the past year. A companion book
introducing data mining using Rattle is under development, with a
draft available for review at:

  http://datamining.togaware.com/survivor/index.html.

Rattle is regularly updated and intermediate releases (between the
more stable CRAN releases) are always available using:

  install.packages("rattle", repos="http://rattle.togaware.com")

Rattle builds upon many R packages. Full installation instructions are
provided at:

  http://datamining.togaware.com/survivor/Installing_Rattle.html

Recent updates include:

* Many bug fixes, GUI simplifications, improved colour usage (through
  the vcd package).

* Streamlined handling of datasets (combined the Data and Select
  tabs), including support for CSV, ARFF, and ODBC data sources.

* Addition of Test and Transforms tabs, with scripting support for
  transforms, both in building a model and in scoring.

* Experimental support for automatic report generation using odfWeave
  (and hence, generation of OpenOffice documents).

* Supported modelling includes: 
  - Cluster (kmeans, hclust)
  - Association Rules (arules)
  - Linear Models (lm, glm)
  - Trees (rpart, party)
  - Neural Nets (nnet)
  - Support Vector Machines (ksvm)
  - Boosting (ada)
  - Random Forests (randomForest)

* Supported data exploration tools include GGobi and PlayWith
  (latticist).  

* ROC curves, CostCurves, and many standard plots are supported.

* Export to PMML is supported for many models, allowing R (and hence
  Rattle) models to be readily exported to other tools (see
  http://www.zementis.com)

* The Business Intelligence vendor, Information Builders
  (http://ibi.com), will soon release RStat (sharing Rattle's open
  source code base) for data mining within WebFocus. Models built
  using RStat are deployable via PMML on all WebFocus hardware
  platforms (over 30 hardware and operating system platforms).

A complete change log is available from 

  http://code.google.com/p/rattle/source/list

Comments, bugs, suggestions are always welcome.

Regards,
Graham

Subject: [R-pkgs] pmml 1.2.0 (predictive modelling markup language)
Message-ID: <20090106081743.GA11865@kyral.togaware.com>

Version 1.2.0 of pmml has been released and is available from CRAN.

The pmml package (http://rattle.togaware.com/pmml.html) is part of the
Rattle data mining suite http://rattle.togaware.com. It generates
representations of analytic models built in R using the open standard
predictive modelling markup language (http://www.dmg.org/).

PMML represents analytic models in an application independent way so
that models developed in R can be loaded into other applications.

Supported models include: arules, hclust, kmeans, ksvm, lm (and glm),
nnet, rpart, and rsf. 

PMML consumers include Information Builders' C code generator (for
deployment of R generated models within Web Focus on all of their
supported platforms), Zementis' scoring engine or cloud computing
application (ADAPA), Teradata's Warehouse Miner and IBM's DB2.

A key update is the incorporation of a framework for dealing with data
transformations. This is ongoing work.

The pmml package is regularly updated and intermediate releases
(between the more stable CRAN releases) are always available using:

  install.packages("pmml", repos="http://rattle.togaware.com")

Comments, bugs, suggestions are always welcome.

Subject: [R-pkgs] caret version 4.06 released
Message-ID: <6731304c0901250956j57e1cf2dlfa4d851b7610d255@mail.gmail.com>

Version 4.06 of the caret package was sent to CRAN.

caret can be used to tune the parameters of predictive models using
resampling, estimate variable importance and visualize the results.
There are also various modeling and "helper" functions that can be
useful for training models. caret has wrappers to over 50 different
models for classification and regression. See the package vignettes or
the paper at

  http://www.jstatsoft.org/v28/i05

for more details.

Significant internal changes were made to how the models are fit in
train(). Now, the function used to compute the models is passed in as
a parameter (defaulting to lapply). In this way, users can use their
own parallel processing software without new versions of caret.
Examples using MPI and NWS are given in ?train.

The package now contains a function (splsda) that extends the spls
function to classification (in the same manner than caret's plsda
function extends plsr).

Also, fixed a bug where the MSE (instead of RMSE) was reported for
random forest OOB resampling

There are more examples in ?train.

Changes to confusionMatrix, sensitivity, specificity and the
predicative value functions:

 - each was made more generic with default and table methods
 - confusionMatrix "extractor" functions for matrices and tables were added
 - the pos/neg predicted value computations were changed to
incorporate prevalence
 - prevalence was added as an option to several functions
 - detection rate and prevalence statistics were added to confusionMatrix
 - the examples were expanded in the help files

This version of caret will break compatibility with caretLSF and
caretNWS. However, these packages will not be needed now (see above)
and will be deprecated. They will work on versions of caret <= 3.51
and will not be developed going forward. However, they can still be
found at

  fhttps://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/caret/

Subject: [R-pkgs] np 0.30-1 (nonparametric kernel smoothing methods for
 mixed data types) is available on CRAN...
Message-ID: <1233270323.39654.109.camel@pc-racine1.economics.mcmaster.ca>

Dear R users,

Version 0.30-1 of the np package has been released and uploaded to CRAN.
The np package provides nonparametric kernel smoothing methods for mixed
data types. We encourage anyone using the package to upgrade to the
latest version.

Description: This package provides a variety of nonparametric (and
semiparametric) kernel methods that seamlessly handle a mix of
continuous, unordered, and ordered factor data types. We would like to
gratefully acknowledge support from  the Natural Sciences and
Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC:www.nserc.ca), the Social
Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC:www.sshrc.ca),
and the Shared Hierarchical Academic Research Computing Network
(SHARCNET:www.sharcnet.ca).

License: GPL
 
Note that version 0.30-0 and 0.30-1 provide some much needed
functionality and bug fixes to the package.

Changes from Version 0.30-0 to 0.30-1 [29-Jan-2009]

* predict now supports bandwidth, density, distribution, conbandwidth,
  condensity, and condistribution objects

* Consistently allow predictions for categorical values outside of
  support of training data

  Note that predictions based upon unconditional density objects
  defined over categorical variables that lie outside the support of
  the training data may no longer be true probabilities (i.e., as
  defined over the training data and the extended/augmented support --
  their sum may exceed one) and may therefore require renormalization
  by the user 

* Fixed a numerical issue which could hinder npregbw()'s cross
  validation with higher-order kernels

* Default nmulti in npplregbw() is now set correctly

* Fixed a bug with the ridging routine in npscoefbw(), added ridging to
  npscoef

* Fixed trivial i/o issue with "Multistart 1 of" using npscoefbw()

Changes from Version 0.20-4 to 0.30-0 [15-Jan-2009]

* Added basic user-interrupt checking for all underlying C code so
  that either <Ctrl-C> (Rterm) or the `STOP' icon (Rgui) will
  interrupt all running processes. This has a number of desirable side
  effects in addition to being able to interrupt C-based processes
  including i) R no longer showing up as `not responding' under the
  task manager (Windows) or the activity monitor (Mac OS X) and ii)
  buffered output now being correctly displayed when using Rgui under
  Windows and Mac OS X

  Note that repeated interruption of large jobs can reduce available
  memory under R - if this becomes an issue (i.e., you get a `cannot
  allocate...' error under R) simply restart R (i.e., exit then run a
  fresh R session)

* Added a function npseed() that allows the user to set/reset the
  random seed for all underlying C routines

* Fixed a bug that caused npplregbw() to ignore any kernel options
  for the regression of y on z

* Refined certain constants used in the normal-reference density
  bandwidth rule for increased accuracy

* Moved from using the maximum likelihood estimate of variance
  throughout to the degrees of freedom corrected estimate (all
  variance estimates now change by the factor (n-1)/n)

Feedback, comments, bug reports, and suggestions for improvement are
always welcome.

Best regards,

Jeff Racine & Tristen Hayfield

Version 3.11 of the survey package is making its way through CRAN.

Since the last announcement on this list, of version 3.9, last September, there have been many minor bug fixes and usability improvements. The main new features are
  - loglinear models with svyloglin()
  - database-backed designs now allow new variables to be created, support ODBC
    in addition to DBI database interfaces, and support multiple imputation
  - there is an approximation (Brewer,2002) for PPS sampling without replacement
  - svysmooth() now does quantile as well as mean smoothing
  - barplot() and dotchart() methods for many objects.

Message-ID: <1B96EF71-F7C9-43BF-BEAC-C9DFC6E26A21@math.uni-augsburg.de>

Version 1.0-0 of fechner has been released to CRAN.

Fechnerian scaling of discrete object (or stimulus) sets provides a  
theoretical framework for deriving, so-called Fechnerian, distances  
among objects representing subjective dissimilarities.  A Fechnerian  
metric on a set of stimuli is constructed from the probabilities with  
which the objects are discriminated from each other by a perceiving  
system. In addition to the oriented and overall Fechnerian distances,  
the package fechner also computes such related information as the  
points of subjective equality, the psychometric increments, the  
geodesic chains and loops with their corresponding lengths, and the  
generalized Shepardian dissimilarities. Moreover, the package fechner  
provides functions for checking the required data format and the  
fundamental regular minimality/maximality condition.

Dear R users,

I'd like to announce the RcmdrPlugin.survival package, which has just been
made available on CRAN. The package provides an R Commander plug-in for the
survival package, with dialogs for Cox models, parametric survival
regression models, estimation of survival curves, and testing for
differences in survival curves, along with data-management facilities and a
variety of tests, diagnostics and graphs. All of this is tightly integrated
with the standard R Commander menus. 

As does the Rcmdr, the package takes advantage of the R facilities for
translating messages into other languages. It comes with a translation into
Brazilian Portuguese, courtesy of Marilia S? Carvalho of FIOCRUZ in Rio de
Janeiro, whose suggestions during the development of the package were
invaluable. Please contact me if you're interested in providing a
translation into another language.

Reports of bugs and other problems are welcome, as are suggestions for
extending the package.

Regards,
 John

ggplot2 ------------------------------------------------------------

ggplot2 is a plotting system for R, based on the grammar of graphics,
which tries to take the good parts of base and lattice graphics and
avoid bad parts. It takes care of many of the fiddly details
that make plotting a hassle (like drawing legends) as well as
providing a powerful model of graphics that makes it easy to produce
complex multi-layered graphics.

Find out more at http://had.co.nz/ggplot2, and check out the nearly 500
examples of ggplot in use.  If you're interested, you can also sign up to
the ggplot2 mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/ggplot2, or track
development at http://github.com/hadley/ggplot2

ggplot2 0.8.2  (2008-02-23)
----------------------------------------

New features

* borders, fortify.map and map_data to make it easier to draw map
borders and choropleth maps

* cut_interval and cut_number utility functions to discretise
continuous variables

* stat_summary has reparameterised to make it easier to specify
different summary functions.  It now has four parameters: fun.y,
fun.ymin and fun.ymax; and fun.data.  See the documentation for
stat_summary for more details

Minor improvements

* ggfluctuation: default to aspect ratio that produces squares
* ggsave: filename now first parameter, not second
* qplot: if sample aesthetic is used, stat automatically set to qq
* scale_datetime: improved breaks calculation
* scale_gradient: better default colour scheme from red to blue
(thanks to Charlotte Wickham for providing the Munsell colours)
* scale_size and scale_area: increased default size range
* stats: all give useful error message if missing a required aesthetic
* theme_set warns if missing needed theme elements
* theme_text: now possible to right and left align text with hjust=0
and hjust=1 respectively

Bug fixes

* be explicit about plyr::is.discrete to avoid clash with Hmisc
* facet_wrap: work around R bug so no longer crashers when ncol = 1
* geom_errorbar now works correctly with dashed lines
* geom_path will now silently ignore lines with less than 2 points
(instead of throwing a mysterious error as before)
* geom_path now responds to the size aesthetic once more
* geom_polygon etc now correctly displays linetype on legends
* geom_step now works with multiple groups
* geom_vline and geom_hline: fix bug when mapping intercept to
variable in data frame
* ggsave: path parameter correctly sets path
* guides: fix broken legend from default stat aesthetics (e.g. for stat_sum)
* scale_manual now works better with missing values
* scale_manual: labels now correctly sets legend labels.
* stat_density_2d: no longer passes unnecessary parameters to kde2d
causing an error message (seen when setting aesthetics with qplot)
* stat_pointrange: better relationship between point and line widths
* stat_sum now correctly preserves other aesthetic columns (should be
a bit faster too)

Dear R Community,

I am pleased to announce that a new version of the mefa R package is
available at the CRAN.

mefa is a package for multivariate data handling in ecology and
biogeography. It provides object classes to represent the data coded
by samples, taxa and segments (i.e., subpopulations, repeated
measures). It supports easy processing of the data along with
relational data tables for samples and taxa. An object of class mefa
is a project specific compendium of the dataset and can be easily used
in further analyses. Methods are provided for extraction, aggregation,
conversion, plotting, summary and reporting of mefa objects. Reports
can be generated in plain text or LaTex.

The current version has been published in JSS (
http://www.jstatsoft.org/v29/i08 ). The paper presents worked examples
on a variety of ecological analyses.

Best wishes,

P?ter

(i.e., ltm_0.9-0 soon available from CRAN) for Item Response Theory 
analyses. This package provides a flexible framework for analyzing 
dichotomous and polytomous data under various IRT models. Furthermore, 
supporting functions for descriptive statistics, goodness-of-fit, 
ability estimation and plotting are available.

New features include:

  * function gpcm() (along with supporting methods, for the generic 
functions, anova, plot, margins, factor.scores, summary, vcov) has been 
added for fitting the Generalized Partial Credit Model. The 'constraint' 
argument of gpcm() can be used to specify constrained versions of the 
model. Options are:

    - 'constraint = "rasch"' that fits the partial credit model (i.e., 
discrimination parameter fixed at one)

    - 'constraint = "1PL"' that specifies a single discrimination 
parameter, equal among items, and

    - 'constraint = "gpcm"' that specifies a different discrimination 
parameter per item.

  * gpcm() also allows for mixed type items, i.e., dichotomous and 
polytomous; however, for data sets with only dichotomous items, 
functions rasch() and ltm() are more efficient.

  * The new function GoF.gpcm() calculates the Pearson chi-squared 
statistic for Generalized Partial Credit models. A p-value can be also 
produced either using the asymptotic chi-squared distribution or a 
parametric Bootstrap approach.

  * The new function rmvordlogis() can be used to simulate ordinal data 
under the Graded Response and the Generalized Partial Credit models.

  * for more details and other new features check the NEWS file that 
ships with the package.

More information as well as *.R files illustrating the capabilities of 
the package can be found in the R-wiki page of 'ltm' available at: 
http://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php?id=packages:cran:ltm.


As always, any kind of feedback (e.g., questions, suggestions, 
bug-reports, etc.) is more than welcome.

Best,
Dimitris

Subject: [R-pkgs] New CRAN Package: WriteXLS
Message-ID: <2CD42541-06B8-499A-9A31-F341C5ED618A@me.com>

A new package called WriteXLS (Version 1.5.0), containing a single  
function of the same name, is now available via CRAN. The package is  
made available under the GPL, version >=2.

The function is based upon a Perl script that I have previously posted  
on r-help, now wrapped in R for convenience. It provides a cross- 
platform function to create Excel 2003 (XLS) files from one or more  
data frames. Each data frame will be written to a separate named  
worksheet in the Excel spreadsheet. The worksheet name will be the  
name of the data frame it contains.

The package requires that Perl and several specific Perl modules are  
installed in order to function. These modules, which may already be  
installed on systems with Perl installed, include:

   OLE::Storage_Lite
   Parse::RecDescent
   Getopt::Long
   File::Basename
   Spreadsheet::WriteExcel
   Encode
   File::Glob
   Text::CSV_XS


With the exception of the last three modules listed, for convenience  
all are included in the CRAN package and will be made available by  
adding the installed package path for these modules to the Perl @INC  
array.

The last three modules (Encode, File::Glob and Text::CSV_XS) are 'XS'  
based Perl modules, meaning that they call external C routines. Thus,  
they are not included as they require local compilation using the  
particular version of Perl installed on the user's system.

As a result, only source versions of the WriteXLS package will be made  
available. This is because the examples on the function help page will  
not run without Perl and all of these modules being available on the  
user's system. Hence the package will presently fail 'R CMD check' on  
CRAN.

For more information on installing source packages from CRAN, please  
see:

   http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Installing- 
packages

WriteXLS is being maintained using R-Forge at:

   http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/writexls

Please feel free to contact me directly with questions and comments.

Many thanks to Prof. Brian Ripley for his assistance with the testing  
of this package prior to release.

Thanks,

Marc Schwartz

Subject: [R-pkgs] data.table is on CRAN (enhanced data.frame for time series
	joins and more)
Message-ID: <B6BD106B14A14CA1BFA74D9956C560D0@ADAM>

Dear all,

The data.table package was released back in August 2008. This email is to 
publicise its existence in response to several suggestions to do so. It 
seems I didn't send a general announcement about it at the time and 
therefore perhaps, not surprisingly, not many people know about it. Glancing 
at some r-help threads recently supports the idea of sending a public 
announcement.

The main difference between data.frame and data.table is enhanced 
functionality in [.data.table where most documentation for this package 
lives i.e. help("[.data.table").  Selected extracts from the package 
documentation follow.

The package builds on base R functionality to reduce 2 types of time :
   1. programming time (easier to write, read, debug and maintain)
   2. compute time
when combining database like operations (subset, with and by) and provides 
similar joins that merge provides but faster. This is achieved by using R's 
column based ordered in-memory data.frame, eval within the environment of a 
list (i.e. with), the [.data.table mechanism to condense the features and 
compiled C to make certain operations fast.

[.data.table is like [.data.frame but i and j can be expressions of column 
names directly. Furthermore i may itself be a data.table which invokes a 
fast table join using binary search in O(log n) time. Allowing i to be 
data.table is consistent with subsetting an n-dimension array by an n-column 
matrix in base R. data.tables do not have rownames but may instead have a 
key of one or more columns using setkey. This key may be used for row 
indexing instead of rownames.

Examples comparing [.data.frame and [.data.table :

DF = data.frame(a=1:5, b=6:10)
DT = data.table(a=1:5, b=6:10)

tt = subset(DF,a==3)
ss = DT[a==3]        # just use the column name 'a' directly. No need to 
remember the comma. The i argument is like the 'where' in SQL.
identical(as.data.table(tt), ss)

tt = with(subset(DF,a==3),a+b+1)
ss = DT[a==3,a+b+1]        # j is like select in SQL and the select argument 
of subset in base R.  j can be an expression of column names directly, 
including a data.table of multiple expressions.  Here the j expression is 
executed just for the rows matching the i argument.
identical(tt, ss)

# Examples above use vector scans i.e. the "a==3" expression first creates a 
logical vector as long as the total number of rows and then evaluates a==3 
for every row.
# Examples below use binary search, invoked by passing in a data.table as 
the i argument. Joins in SQL are performed in the where clause and the i 
argument is like where, so this seems very natural (to me anyway!)

DT = data.table(a=letters[1:5], b=6:10)
setkey(DT,a)
identical(DT[J("d")], DT[4])        # binary search to row for 'd'

DT = data.table(id=rep(c("A","B"),each=3), 
date=c(20080501L,20080502L,20080506L), v=1:6)
setkey(DT,id,date)
DT["A"]                                        # all 3 rows for A since mult 
by default is "all"
DT[J("A",20080502L)]                 # row for A where date also matches 
exactly
DT[J("A",20080505L)]                 # NA since 5 May is missing (outer join 
by default)
DT[J("A",20080505L),nomatch=0]             # inner join instead
dts = c(20080501L, 20080502L, 20080505L, 20080506L, 20080507L, 20080508L)
DT[J("A",dts)]                             # 3 of the dates in dts match 
exactly
DT[J("A",dts),roll=TRUE]                   # roll previous data forward i.e. 
return the prevailing observation
DT[J("A",dts),rolltolast=TRUE]             # roll all but last observation 
forward

tables(mb=TRUE)   # prints table names, number of rows, size in memory


Thanks to all those who have made suggestions and feedback so far. Further 
comments and feedback on the package would be much appreciated.

Regards, Matthew

Subject: [R-pkgs] WriteXLS: New version 1.6.0 - Binary CRAN packages
 available and other changes
Message-ID: <0BE7FC8E-7AF9-4D8C-B8AC-6DC1AA6F3C7A@me.com>

Hi all,

A new version of the WriteXLS package, 1.6.0, is making its way around  
the CRAN mirrors and should be generally available in the next 24-48  
hours.

The WriteXLS package provides a cross-platform perl based R function  
to create Excel (XLS) files from one or more data frames. Each data  
frame will be written to a separate named worksheet in the Excel  
spreadsheet. The worksheet name will be the name of the data frame it  
contains.

Key changes from version 1.5.0:

1. Thanks to work by Uwe Ligges and changes to the examples being  
used, Windows and OSX binary versions of the package will become  
available to enable their easier installation using install.packages()  
within an R session.

2. A new function called testPerl() has been added to enable the self- 
checking of the user's system to ensure that Perl and all required  
Perl modules are available to use the WriteXLS() function. The package  
will return either success or error messages indicating missing  
requirements. If you are unsure as to whether or not you have all  
requirements, you can run this function prior to using the WriteXLS()  
function.

3. A new INSTALL file has been created and is in the main package  
installation directory. An online copy is also available from CRAN at:

   http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WriteXLS/INSTALL

The INSTALL file contains additional information on the package  
requirements and recommendations for meeting them. Details are  
provided for Windows, OSX and Linux relative to options for installing  
Perl and any missing modules.

The WriteXLS package is being maintained on R-Forge at:

   https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/writexls/

Marc Schwartz

Subject: [R-pkgs] New R graphics package targeting HTML 5 canvas element
Message-ID: <49D61338.4000203@vanderbilt.edu>

Hi,

canvas is a new R package implementing a graphics device that emits 
javascript code conforming to the HTML 5 CanvasRenderingContext2D 
interface. Available on CRAN soon, but you can get it here immediately:

http://www.rforge.net/canvas

If you have access to a beta web browser like Firefox 3.1 or later, you 
can see example plots here:

http://www.rforge.net/canvas/plots/index.html

Clicking on one of the plots will take you to a comparator page where 
the plot is rendered twice, once with the canvas package and once with 
the png(type='cairo') function.

The implementation is almost complete, however there are some parts that 
need work like font metrics and dotted/dashed lines. If anyone is 
interested in helping flesh out the remaining bits, I'd be much obliged.

Best,

Jeff

Subject: [R-pkgs] [ANN] plyr version 0.1.7
Message-ID: <f8e6ff050904151646g40db1550i6ca7ac7587b90992@mail.gmail.com>

plyr is a set of tools for a common set of problems: you need to break
down a big data structure into manageable pieces, operate on each
piece and then put all the pieces back together.  For example, you
might want to:

  * fit the same model to subsets of a data frame
  * quickly calculate summary statistics for each group
  * perform group-wise transformations like scaling or standardising
  * eliminate for-loops in your code

It's already possible to do this with built-in functions (like split
and the apply functions), but plyr just makes it all a bit easier
with:

  * absolutely consistent names, arguments and outputs
  * input from and output to data.frames, matrices and lists
  * progress bars to keep track of long running operations
  * built-in error recovery, and informative error messages

Some considerable effort has been put into making plyr fast and memory
efficient, and in most cases it is faster than the built-in functions.

You can find out more at http://had.co.nz/plyr/, including a 20 page
introductory guide, http://had.co.nz/plyr/plyr-intro.pdf.  You can ask
questions about plyr (and data-manipulation in general) on the plyr
mailing list.  Sign up at http://groups.google.com/group/manipulatr


plyr 0.1.7 (2008-04-15) ---------------------------------------------------

Ensure that rbind.fill preserves attributes.

plyr 0.1.6 (2008-04-15) ---------------------------------------------------

Improvements:

* all ply functions deal more elegantly when given function names: can
supply a vector of function names, and name is used as label in output
* failwith and each now work with function names as well as functions
(i.e. "nrow" instead of nrow)
* each now accepts a list of functions or a vector of function names
* l*ply will use list names where present
* if .inform is TRUE, error messages will give you information about
where errors within your data - hopefully this will make problems
easier to track down

Speed-ups

* massive speed ups for splitting large arrays
* fixed typo that was causing a 50% speed penalty for d*ply
* rewritten rbind.fill is considerably (> 4x) faster for many data frames
* colwise about twice as fast

Bug fixes:

* daply: now works when the data frame is split by multiple variables
* aaply: now works with vectors
* ddply: first variable now varies slowest as you'd expect


plyr 0.1.5 (2008-02-23) ---------------------------------------------------

* colwise now accepts a quoted list as its second argument.  This
allows you to specify the names of columns to work on: colwise(mean,
.(lat, long))
* d_ply and a_ply now correctly pass ... to the function

Dear useRs,

The FD package is intended for ecologists interested in functional
diversity (FD). It measures different functional diversity indices
from multiple traits (any type of traits). The first version of FD
(1.0-0) is now available on CRAN:

http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FD/

The main functions of FD are:

dbFD: Compute different multidimensional FD indices

gowdis: Gower dissimilarity, including options for variable weights,
asymetric binary variables, and implementing Podani's (1999) extension
to ordinal variables

fdisp: Functional dispersion

functcomp: Functional composition (community-weighted means ot trait
values, or CWM)

I hope that FD will be useful to you. Feedback would be appreciated.

Sincerely,

Etienne Lalibert?

Message-ID: <d70c15d40904180218v3d452e29j34b89f109889a8fd@mail.gmail.com>

igraph is a package for graphs/networks. It has a C core and
uses a simple and fast graph representation allowing millions
of vertices and edges.

Release notes for the 0.5.1 version:
http://igraph.sourceforge.net/relnotes-0.5.1.html

Complete list of changes:
http://igraph.sourceforge.net/news.html

The igraph homepage: http://igraph.sf.net

Since there was no announcement about igraph version 0.5.1
on R-pkgs, here is a list of the more important new things of both
version 0.5.2 and 0.5.1.

NEW FEATURES IN THE 0.5.2 VERSION

- We have some support for bipartite (two-mode) graphs now.
  See ?graph.incidence, ?get.incidence for dealing with
  incidence matrices, ?graph.bipartite for a way to
  create bipartite graphs, ?bipartite.projection for
  creating one-mode projections. See ?is.bipartite for
  deciding whether a graph has a bipartite structure.
- A new simple and fast community finding algorithm called 'label
  propagation' was added, see ?label.propagation.community
  for details.
- The DrL layout generator now supports 3d layouts.
- A limited Tcl/Tk igraph GUI was added, please note that it supports
  only a small fraction of the igraph functions. You can start it with
  the tkigraph() function.
- Johnson's algorithm is now supported by the shortest path finder.
  It allows negative edge weight, but not negative cycles.
  See ?shortest.paths.
- The graph.knn function was added to calculate the average
  nearest neighbor degree. It supports edge weights as well.
- Curved edges are now supported by plot() and tkplot(), see
  ?igraph.plotting for the details.
- Many bugs and memory leaks were fixed, see the News section on the
  igraph homepage for details.

NEW FEATURES IN THE 0.5.1 VERSION

- DrL layout generator was added, see ?layout.drl.
- Uniform sampling of graphs with a given degree sequence,
  see ?degree.sequence.game.
- Conversion functions to/from graphNEL objects (graph package),
  see ?igraph.to.graphNEL and ?igraph.from.graphNEL.
- Conversion functions to/from sparse matrices (Matrix package),
  see ?graph.adjacency and the 'sparse' argument of
  ?get.adjacency.
- Creating graphs from adjacency lists, see ?graph.adjlist.
- The function graph.data.frame has an argument called
  'vertices' and this makes it very easy to create graphs
  with a lot of vertex and edge metadata.
- The Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithms
  were added, see ?shortest.paths.
- The function is.mutual() was added, this tests edge reciprocity.
- The plot() function now supports plottings different vertex
  shapes. See ?igraph.plotting and ?igraph.vertex.shapes for
  detaills.
- Many bugs were fixed, see the News section on the igraph
  homepage for details.

PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:

igraph is originally a C library for graphs, but has interfaces
to high level languages like R, Python and Ruby. The R package
contains BOTH the C library and its R interface.

igraph supports:

- graph generators, creating both regular structures like trees,
  lattices, etc. and various random graphs.
- a rich set of functions calculating structural properties of
  graphs, like vertex centrality (degree, betweenness, closeness,
  page rank, eigenvector centrality, Burt's constraints, etc.),
  shortest paths, dyad and triad census, network motifs, girth,
  K-core decomposition, etc.
- attributes can be associated with the vertices/edges of the graph,
  or the graph itself. The attributes can be arbitrary R objects.
- graph visualization using regular R devices, interactive visualization
  using Tcl/Tk, 3D visualization using RGL.
- graph layout generators, the standard Kamada-Kawai and
  Fruchterman-Reingold algorithms are included, plus many more.
- Functions for graph and subgraph isomorphism, the BLISS and the VF2
  algorithms are included.
- Functions for maximal network flows, minimal cuts, vertex and
  edge connectivity.
- igraph can read and write many popular file formats used for
  storing graph data: GraphML, Pajek, GML and others.
- igraph contains implementations of many community structure
  detection algorithms proposed recently.

Subject: [R-pkgs] xterm256
Message-ID: <49EC2B17.7030107@dbmail.com>

This is the first release of the xterm256 package.

xterm256 is a small package that takes advantage of the 256 color mode 
of xterm, enabling use of foreground and background colors in the R 
console. The package exposes one function "style" that takes three 
arguments:
- (x) the text to style
- (bg) the background color to use
- (fg) the foreground color to use

The color might be specified as an number between 0 and 255 (see 
http://frexx.de/xterm-256-notes/), as classic hex notation ( "#ff0000" ) 
or as an R color ("red"). Note that the color specified is mapped to the 
closest color of the 256 colors using an euclidean distance in the RGB 
space.

The package is maintained at r-forge as part of the highlight project: 
http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/highlight/ and welcomes requests 
(feature requests, bug requests, ...) though its tracker : 
http://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/?group_id=384

Below you find a list of major improvements in version 2.1:

%---------------------------------------------
SweaveListingUtils:
%---------------------------------------------
  + a new package devoted to joining markup provided by TeX package
      'listings' with Sweave;
  + also covers inclusion of code sniplets from an url
     (notably r-forge) in order to ease consistency
      of documentation with code that is being developed.
    see also ?lstinputSourceFromRForge and
    vignette "ExampleSweaveListingUtils"
%---------------------------------------------
distr
%---------------------------------------------
  COMPOUND DISTRIBUTIONS
  + new support of compound distributions,
      see ?CompoundDistribution, class?CompoundDistribution
  ENHANCED ACCURACY
  + by log scale
       Following Peter Dalgaard's hint
         https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2008-September/174295.html
       we use the log.p argument to be able to simulate accurately from
       the far out tails.
  + refined collapsing technique for DiscreteDistribution
  + more frequent use of FFT for convolution by better treatment of
      joint lattices
  AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF IMAGE DISTRIBUTION
  + slot r is now /much/ faster / slimmer for results of *,/,^
  + slot d for results of *,/, exp() now is correct at 0 by extrapolation
  COMFORT METHODS
  + getLow/getUp methods  (for "reasonable" endpoints for distributions with
       possibly unbounded support) for
       *DiscreteDistribution,
       *AbscontDistribution,
       *UnivarLebDecDistribution,
       *UnivarMixingDistribution
  + q.r, p.l (methods for right continuous quantile function
              and left continuous cdf) for
       * DiscreteDistribution
       * AbscontDistribution (takes care of constancy regions in p)
       * UnivarLebDecDistribution
       * UnivarMixingDistribution
  + prob methods (returning vectors/matrices of probabilities of support)
       + DiscreteDistribution
       + UnivarLebDecDistribution (conditional/unconditional)
  + p.ac, d.ac, p.discrete, d.discrete methods (for
UnivarLebDecDistribution)
        now conditional/unconditional
%---------------------------------------------
distrEx
%---------------------------------------------
  FUNCTIONALS
  + expectation gains explicit arguments to set accuracy locally;
  + median and IQR are now defined for UnivariateCondDistribution
  + cross-checked (and bug-fixed) particular functionals against
      general implementations
  DISTRIBUTIONS
  + gains distribution Pareto; ported from pkg actuar by Nataliya Horbenko
  DISTANCES:
  + introduces distances asymmetric total variation distances
     *OAsymTotalVarDist
     *AsymTotalVarDist
  + TotalVarDist and HellingerDist gain extra arguments

%---------------------------------------------
  MODELS
  + added mad.const to guarantee for mad-consistency in location scale model
      for general central distribution
  TRAFO
  + fixed some inconsistencies with slot trafo:
      now when trafo is a function, we try to keep it as a function under
      moves of the parametric model

Subject: [R-pkgs] [ANN] ggplot2 version 0.8.3
Message-ID: <f8e6ff050904201821r22a30dcfp6d9dbbd521cdfcd0@mail.gmail.com>

ggplot2 ------------------------------------------------------------

ggplot2 is a plotting system for R, based on the grammar of graphics,
which tries to take the good parts of base and lattice graphics and
avoid bad parts. It takes care of many of the fiddly details
that make plotting a hassle (like drawing legends) as well as
providing a powerful model of graphics that makes it easy to produce
complex multi-layered graphics.

To install or update, run:
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "plyr"))

Find out more at http://had.co.nz/ggplot2, and check out the nearly 500
examples of ggplot in use.  If you're interested, you can also sign up to
the ggplot2 mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/ggplot2, or track
development at  http://github.com/hadley/ggplot2

ggplot2 0.8.3  (2008-04-20)
----------------------------------------

New features

* alpha: new aesthetic, with scale alpha.  Where a geom has both fill
and colour, alpha affects the fill.
* annotate: new annotate function to make it easier to add annotations to plots
* facet_grid now takes strip label function from parameter labeller,
not theme setting
* facet_grid: gains as.table argument to control direction of horizontal facets
* fortify: full set of methods for turning data from the sp package
into data frames that can be plotted with ggplot2
* geom_errorbarh: new geom for horizontal error bars
* labels_parsed and labels_bquote functions to make it easier to
display expressions on facet labels
* scale_manual now supports breaks and limits
* subset: experimental new feature.  Layers now have a subset
argument, which takes subsets formatted like .(var1 < 5, var2 == 3)
etc.
* xlim and ylim now work recognise Date and POSIXct classes to create
date and date_time scales respectively

Dealing with missing values

* facet_wrap: add drop argument to control whether or not panels for
non-existent combinations of facetting variables should be dropped or
not.  Defaults to TRUE
* scale_discrete: empty factor levels will be preserved, unless drop = TRUE

Bug fixes

* added presidents dataset from book to package
* American spelling of color accepted in as geom parameter, and all
colour scales have alias spelled color (e.g. scale_color_hue)
* facet_wrap: contents guaranteed to be clipped to panel
* facet_wrap: corrected labelling when facetting by multiple variables
(thank to Charlotte Wickham for a clear test case)
* geom_histogram now works with negative weights (provided position =
"identity").  This is useful for creating back to back histograms.
* geom_step: improve legend
* geom_text: better legend
* geom_vline, geom_hline, geom_abline: should work in yet more situations
* resolution: fixed bug in computation of resolution that lead to
(e.g.) incorrect boxplot widths when there was only a single x value
in a group.
* position_stack: fixed bug in detection of overlap for very large bins
* scale_discrete: factor levels no longer mistakenly reordered
* scale_hue: now spans full range of hue if it less than 360 degrees
* scale_hue: rotated default hue range by 15 degrees to avoid
unfortunate red-green contrast in two colour case
* show now works with ggplot objects
* stat_sum: fixed bug which resulted in dropped aesthetics
* stat_summary: now warns when dropping records with missing values
* stat_summary: should be a little faster
* stat_summary: correctly passes ... arguments on fun.data
* theme_bw: corrected justification of axis.text.y
* trans: bug fixes to logistic transformation
* order aesthetic should work again

Subject: [R-pkgs] Sequence analysis with TraMineR 1.2
Message-ID: <49EF2605.4040701@unige.ch>

Dear R users,

The TraMineR package for mining, describing and visualizing sequences of 
states or events, and more generally discrete sequential data has been 
updated to version 1.2. Its primary aim is the analysis of biographical 
longitudinal data in the social sciences, such as data describing 
careers or family trajectories. Most of its features apply however also 
to non temporal data such as text or DNA sequences for instance. These are

   * Handling of longitudinal data and conversion between various 
sequence formats
   * Plotting sequences (density plot, frequency plot, index plot and more)
   * Centro-type and heterogeneity measure of a set of sequences
   * Individual longitudinal characteristics of sequences (length, time 
in each state, longitudinal entropy, turbulence and more)
   * Sequence transversal characteristics by age point (transversal 
state distribution, transversal entropy, modal state)
   * Other aggregated characteristics (transition rates, average 
duration in each state, sequence frequency)
   * Dissimilarities between pairs of sequences using several metric 
(Optimal matching, longest common prefix, longest common postfix, 
longest common subsequence)
   * ANOVA-like analysis of sequences and tree structured ANOVA from 
dissimilarities
   * Extracting frequent event subsequences
   * Identifying most discriminating event subsequences

More information about TraMineR can be found  here:  
http://mephisto.unige.ch/traminer/

Cheers,
The TraMineR team.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package: CHNOSZ
Message-ID: <49F24C42.1070905@asu.edu>

Dear R users,

A new package, CHNOSZ (version 0.8), is available on CRAN.

CHNOSZ is a package for thermodynamic calculations and analysis. 
Functions are available for calculating the standard Gibbs energies and 
other thermodynamic properties, and chemical affinities, of reactions 
between species contained in the thermodynamic database. The database 
includes standard thermodynamic properties and equations of state 
parameters for a variety of minerals and inorganic and organic aqueous 
species. The relative abundances of species in equilibrium can be drawn 
on activity diagrams as a function of temperature, pressure and/or 
chemical activities of basis species.

The documentation includes many examples taken from the literature, as 
well as calculations of the metastability relationships in systems of 
proteins. The protein examples were developed to explore the chemical 
features of thermophilic adaptation, subcellular localization, proteomic 
stress response, and microbial diversity. Calculation of the standard 
Gibbs energies of proteins is based on a published group additivity 
algorithm and is further supported in this package by the inclusion of 
data files for the amino acid compositions of selected proteins and of 
proteins in yeast and E. coli.

A paper describing some applications of the package can be found in 
Geochemical Transactions:

http://www.geochemicaltransactions.com/content/9/1/10

The project website highlights many of the example calculations. There 
is also an Rpad script available for download that presents basic 
functionality of the program in a browser interface. The website is 
located at:

http://www.chnosz.net

This release offers major enhancements over previous versions available 
on the project website. Chemical affinities of formation reactions can 
be calculated as a function of more than two variables, parallel 
processing of some computations is optionally carried out using the 
mclapply function of the multicore package, amino acid compositions of 
proteins can be read from FASTA files, protein stress response and 
richness calculations were added to the examples, and a mass transfer 
algorithm for reaction path modeling has been introduced.

Feedback about the package is appreciated.

Sincerely,

Jeff Dick

Subject: [R-pkgs] frontier 0.99 is NOT backward compatible
Message-ID: <200905042045.00741.arne.henningsen@googlemail.com>

Dear current (and future) users of the "frontier" package,

We are approaching the first stable version (1.0) of the frontier package, 
which provides tools for microeconomic Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). 
I have uploaded a kind of beta release (version 0.99) of this package to CRAN. 
The most important differences to version 0.9 affect the user interface. I 
have modified the package so that it is (hopefully) simpler to use and the 
functions are more similar to other R functions. Unfortunately, these changes 
make the new version NOT backward compatible. The most significant changes are 
reported below. A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN 
repository on R-Forge [1]. Feedback about this package is highly appreciated. 
Please report any bugs, suggestions, feature requests, comments, and questions 
in the forums and trackers on R-Forge [1].

[1] http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/frontier/

Best regards,
Arne


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99-0

* corrected and considerably improved documentation of function "fontier"

* changed order of arguments of function "frontier"

* removed arguments "crossSectionName" and "timePeriodName" from function
"frontier": in case of cross-section data, these variables (information) are
not needed, and in case of panel data, the information on the panel structure
has to be added to the data set by the function "plm.data" of the "plm" 
package

* argument "modelType" of function "frontier" must be "ECF" or "EEF" now

* replaced argument "funtionType" of function "frontier"
by argument "ineffDecrease"

* renamed argument "eta" of function "frontier" as "timeEffect"

* split argument "mu" of function "frontier" into "truncNorm"
and "zIntercept"

* increased default value of argument "maxit" of function "frontier" to 1000

* renamed argument "step1" of function "frontier" as "searchStep"

* renamed argument "tol2" of function "frontier" as "searchTol"

* replaced argument "indic" of function "frontier" by "searchScale"

* renamed argument "gridno" of function "frontier" as "gridSize"

* renamed argument "igrid2" of function "frontier" as "gridDouble"

* renamed argument "iprint" of function "frontier" as "printIter"

* removed arguments "qxNames" and "quadHalf" from function "frontier",
because quadratic or translog frontiers can be estimated with function
"frontierQuad" now

* added "logLik" method for objects of class "frontier"

* added function "frontierQuad" for estimating quadratic and translog 
frontiers

* added function "frontierTranslogRay" for estimating stochastic ray
translog frontier functions

* added the generic function "efficiencies" and corresponding methods
for default objects and objects of class "frontier"

* added "elas" method for objects of class "frontierQuad"

* function frontier() and frontierQuad() return the (matched) call now

* the matrix of efficiency estimates returned by "frontier" has row names
(cross section units) and possibly column names (time period) now

Subject: [R-pkgs] New version of actuar
Message-ID: <0A5A4124-CF2B-4661-91D4-94A244CEC518@act.ulaval.ca>

Dear useRs,

A new version of actuar is available since last Friday. This is mainly  
a bugfix release. From the NEWS file:

Version 1.0-2
=============

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

o m<foo>() and lev<foo>() now return Inf instead of NaN for infinite
moments. (Thanks to David Humke for the idea.)

BUG FIXES

o Non-ascii characters in one R source file prevented compilation of
the package in a C locale (at least on OS X).

o For probability laws that have a strictly positive mode or a mode
at zero depending on the value of one or more shape parameters,
d<foo>(0, ...) did not handle correctly the case exactly at the
boundary condition.

actuar is a package offering additional actuarial science  
functionality to R, mostly in the fields of loss distributions, risk  
theory (including ruin theory), simulation of compound hierarchical  
models and credibility theory

Message-ID: <68e086180905200347sb72adf4x7734169f64bc024f@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

The "tractor.base" package has recently been added to CRAN. This
package provides functions to read, write, visualise and manipulate
magnetic resonance images. The standard Analyze, NIfTI and DICOM file
formats are supported (read-only for DICOM), and all metadata is
stored with the image data internally. The code can be used to
visualise image slices or maximum intensity projections; and to apply
masking, thresholding or other arbitrary functions to the image data.
The package is written in pure R.

This package stands alone, but it is also part of the larger TractoR
project for working with MR images and diffusion MR based
tractography. Further information about TractoR can be found at
<http://code.google.com/p/tractor>.

Regards,
Jon

Message-ID: <EF4C0973-C4EE-4774-AD03-7F99D46D4D57@me.com>

The updated package has been submitted to CRAN and will propagate to  
mirrors over the next day or so.

It is maintained on R-Forge at http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/writexls 
, where downloads are available as well.



Package: WriteXLS

Version: 1.7.1

Description: Cross-platform perl based R function to create Excel (XLS)
files from one or more data frames. Each data frame will be written to a
separate named worksheet in the Excel spreadsheet. The worksheet name  
will
be the name of the data frame it contains or can be specified by the  
user.

Author(s): Marc Schwartz <marc_schwartz at me.com>
Maintainer: Marc Schwartz <marc_schwartz at me.com>

License: GPL (>=2)


Changes since version 1.6.0:

1. Added \'verbose\' argument to testPerl so that it can be used in an
if() manner without console output

2. Added \'SheetNames\' argument to WriteXLS to enable user specified
worksheet names

3. Added various checks to code for unique worksheet names, worksheet
names <= 31 chars, length(SheetNames) == length(x)

4. Added check for invalid worksheet names for chars []:*?/\\

5. Added argument \'--SN\' to WriteXLS.pl to support SheetNames from
WriteXLS.R

6. Modified WriteXLS.pl to handle SheetNames.txt file and related
activity

7. Substantive changes to WriteXLS.Rd to describe new function arguments
and additional validity checks.

8. Fixed typos in e-mail in both help files.

9. New \'envir\' argument to WriteXLS to enable WriteXLS to be wrapped
in other functions and locate the data frames to be written.

10. Reduced SystemRequirements in DESCRIPTION file to only those Perl
modules not included in the package.

11. Added TRUE/FALSE invisible return values to WriteXLS to enable the
function to be tested for success or failure. Note that error messages
will still be output.


Regards to all,

Marc Schwartz

Subject: [R-pkgs] (ORPHANED) rimage 0.5-8 package uploaded
Message-ID: <4A284574.1000408@ucla.edu>

Hi,

With the help of Dirk Eddelbuettel, I was able to fix a few little 
problems that prevented the rimage (0.5-7) package from working under 
(at least) R 2.8 or 2.9 and g++ 4.2 or 4.3.  I have uploaded a new 
release, 0.5-8, that fixes these problems. 

It have attempted to contact the package's  maintainer, Tomomi TAKASHINA 
<t.takashina at computer.org>, to no avail.   Kurt Hornik has also not been 
able to make contact with Tomomi. 

At Kurt's suggestion, I have changed the maintainer to "ORPHANED."

Best,

Jeff Lewis

Subject: [R-pkgs] Rattle 2.4.0 (Data Mining GUI using R)
Message-ID: <20090104214051.GB25424@kyral.togaware.com>

Version 2.4.0 of Rattle has been released to CRAN.

The rattle package (http://rattle.togaware.com) is a multi platform
(GNU/Linux, Mac/OSX, MS/Windows) GTK based GUI for data mining (for
exploring data and building descriptive and predictive models). It has
undergone a lot of development over the past year. A companion book
introducing data mining using Rattle is under development, with a
draft available for review at:

  http://datamining.togaware.com/survivor/index.html.

Rattle is regularly updated and intermediate releases (between the
more stable CRAN releases) are always available using:

  install.packages("rattle", repos="http://rattle.togaware.com")

Rattle builds upon many R packages. Full installation instructions are
provided at:

  http://datamining.togaware.com/survivor/Installing_Rattle.html

Recent updates include:

* Many bug fixes, GUI simplifications, improved colour usage (through
  the vcd package).

* Streamlined handling of datasets (combined the Data and Select
  tabs), including support for CSV, ARFF, and ODBC data sources.

* Addition of Test and Transforms tabs, with scripting support for
  transforms, both in building a model and in scoring.

* Experimental support for automatic report generation using odfWeave
  (and hence, generation of OpenOffice documents).

* Supported modelling includes: 
  - Cluster (kmeans, hclust)
  - Association Rules (arules)
  - Linear Models (lm, glm)
  - Trees (rpart, party)
  - Neural Nets (nnet)
  - Support Vector Machines (ksvm)
  - Boosting (ada)
  - Random Forests (randomForest)

* Supported data exploration tools include GGobi and PlayWith
  (latticist).  

* ROC curves, CostCurves, and many standard plots are supported.

* Export to PMML is supported for many models, allowing R (and hence
  Rattle) models to be readily exported to other tools (see
  http://www.zementis.com)

* The Business Intelligence vendor, Information Builders
  (http://ibi.com), will soon release RStat (sharing Rattle's open
  source code base) for data mining within WebFocus. Models built
  using RStat are deployable via PMML on all WebFocus hardware
  platforms (over 30 hardware and operating system platforms).

A complete change log is available from 

  http://code.google.com/p/rattle/source/list

Comments, bugs, suggestions are always welcome.

Regards,
Graham

Subject: [R-pkgs] pmml 1.2.0 (predictive modelling markup language)
Message-ID: <20090106081743.GA11865@kyral.togaware.com>

Version 1.2.0 of pmml has been released and is available from CRAN.

The pmml package (http://rattle.togaware.com/pmml.html) is part of the
Rattle data mining suite http://rattle.togaware.com. It generates
representations of analytic models built in R using the open standard
predictive modelling markup language (http://www.dmg.org/).

PMML represents analytic models in an application independent way so
that models developed in R can be loaded into other applications.

Supported models include: arules, hclust, kmeans, ksvm, lm (and glm),
nnet, rpart, and rsf. 

PMML consumers include Information Builders' C code generator (for
deployment of R generated models within Web Focus on all of their
supported platforms), Zementis' scoring engine or cloud computing
application (ADAPA), Teradata's Warehouse Miner and IBM's DB2.

A key update is the incorporation of a framework for dealing with data
transformations. This is ongoing work.

The pmml package is regularly updated and intermediate releases
(between the more stable CRAN releases) are always available using:

  install.packages("pmml", repos="http://rattle.togaware.com")

Comments, bugs, suggestions are always welcome.

Graham

A new package ConvCalendars is on CRAN, in response to requests earlier this week.

It performs conversions between the Gregorian calendar and other calendars including the Persian (Jalali) calendar used in Iran and Afghanistan and the Hebrew calendar used in Israel.

All the heavy lifting is done by C code from http://www.projectpluto.com.

Subject: [R-pkgs] caret version 4.06 released
Message-ID: <6731304c0901250956j57e1cf2dlfa4d851b7610d255@mail.gmail.com>

Version 4.06 of the caret package was sent to CRAN.

caret can be used to tune the parameters of predictive models using
resampling, estimate variable importance and visualize the results.
There are also various modeling and "helper" functions that can be
useful for training models. caret has wrappers to over 50 different
models for classification and regression. See the package vignettes or
the paper at

  http://www.jstatsoft.org/v28/i05

for more details.

Significant internal changes were made to how the models are fit in
train(). Now, the function used to compute the models is passed in as
a parameter (defaulting to lapply). In this way, users can use their
own parallel processing software without new versions of caret.
Examples using MPI and NWS are given in ?train.

The package now contains a function (splsda) that extends the spls
function to classification (in the same manner than caret's plsda
function extends plsr).

Also, fixed a bug where the MSE (instead of RMSE) was reported for
random forest OOB resampling

There are more examples in ?train.

Changes to confusionMatrix, sensitivity, specificity and the
predicative value functions:

 - each was made more generic with default and table methods
 - confusionMatrix "extractor" functions for matrices and tables were added
 - the pos/neg predicted value computations were changed to
incorporate prevalence
 - prevalence was added as an option to several functions
 - detection rate and prevalence statistics were added to confusionMatrix
 - the examples were expanded in the help files

This version of caret will break compatibility with caretLSF and
caretNWS. However, these packages will not be needed now (see above)
and will be deprecated. They will work on versions of caret <= 3.51
and will not be developed going forward. However, they can still be
found at

  fhttps://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/caret/

Send questions, comments etc to max.kuhn at pfizer.com.

Subject: [R-pkgs] np 0.30-1 (nonparametric kernel smoothing methods for
 mixed data types) is available on CRAN...
Message-ID: <1233270323.39654.109.camel@pc-racine1.economics.mcmaster.ca>

Dear R users,

Version 0.30-1 of the np package has been released and uploaded to CRAN.
The np package provides nonparametric kernel smoothing methods for mixed
data types. We encourage anyone using the package to upgrade to the
latest version.

Description: This package provides a variety of nonparametric (and
semiparametric) kernel methods that seamlessly handle a mix of
continuous, unordered, and ordered factor data types. We would like to
gratefully acknowledge support from  the Natural Sciences and
Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC:www.nserc.ca), the Social
Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC:www.sshrc.ca),
and the Shared Hierarchical Academic Research Computing Network
(SHARCNET:www.sharcnet.ca).

License: GPL
 
Note that version 0.30-0 and 0.30-1 provide some much needed
functionality and bug fixes to the package.

Changes from Version 0.30-0 to 0.30-1 [29-Jan-2009]

* predict now supports bandwidth, density, distribution, conbandwidth,
  condensity, and condistribution objects

* Consistently allow predictions for categorical values outside of
  support of training data

  Note that predictions based upon unconditional density objects
  defined over categorical variables that lie outside the support of
  the training data may no longer be true probabilities (i.e., as
  defined over the training data and the extended/augmented support --
  their sum may exceed one) and may therefore require renormalization
  by the user 

* Fixed a numerical issue which could hinder npregbw()'s cross
  validation with higher-order kernels

* Default nmulti in npplregbw() is now set correctly

* Fixed a bug with the ridging routine in npscoefbw(), added ridging to
  npscoef

* Fixed trivial i/o issue with "Multistart 1 of" using npscoefbw()

Changes from Version 0.20-4 to 0.30-0 [15-Jan-2009]

* Added basic user-interrupt checking for all underlying C code so
  that either <Ctrl-C> (Rterm) or the `STOP' icon (Rgui) will
  interrupt all running processes. This has a number of desirable side
  effects in addition to being able to interrupt C-based processes
  including i) R no longer showing up as `not responding' under the
  task manager (Windows) or the activity monitor (Mac OS X) and ii)
  buffered output now being correctly displayed when using Rgui under
  Windows and Mac OS X

  Note that repeated interruption of large jobs can reduce available
  memory under R - if this becomes an issue (i.e., you get a `cannot
  allocate...' error under R) simply restart R (i.e., exit then run a
  fresh R session)

* Added a function npseed() that allows the user to set/reset the
  random seed for all underlying C routines

* Fixed a bug that caused npplregbw() to ignore any kernel options
  for the regression of y on z

* Refined certain constants used in the normal-reference density
  bandwidth rule for increased accuracy

* Moved from using the maximum likelihood estimate of variance
  throughout to the degrees of freedom corrected estimate (all
  variance estimates now change by the factor (n-1)/n)

Feedback, comments, bug reports, and suggestions for improvement are
always welcome.

Best regards,

Jeff Racine & Tristen Hayfield

Version 3.11 of the survey package is making its way through CRAN.

Since the last announcement on this list, of version 3.9, last September, there have been many minor bug fixes and usability improvements. The main new features are
  - loglinear models with svyloglin()
  - database-backed designs now allow new variables to be created, support ODBC
    in addition to DBI database interfaces, and support multiple imputation
  - there is an approximation (Brewer,2002) for PPS sampling without replacement
  - svysmooth() now does quantile as well as mean smoothing
  - barplot() and dotchart() methods for many objects.

Message-ID: <1B96EF71-F7C9-43BF-BEAC-C9DFC6E26A21@math.uni-augsburg.de>

Version 1.0-0 of fechner has been released to CRAN.

Fechnerian scaling of discrete object (or stimulus) sets provides a  
theoretical framework for deriving, so-called Fechnerian, distances  
among objects representing subjective dissimilarities.  A Fechnerian  
metric on a set of stimuli is constructed from the probabilities with  
which the objects are discriminated from each other by a perceiving  
system. In addition to the oriented and overall Fechnerian distances,  
the package fechner also computes such related information as the  
points of subjective equality, the psychometric increments, the  
geodesic chains and loops with their corresponding lengths, and the  
generalized Shepardian dissimilarities. Moreover, the package fechner  
provides functions for checking the required data format and the  
fundamental regular minimality/maximality condition.

Message-ID: <000601c9942d$188924d0$499b6e70$@ca>

Dear R users,

I'd like to announce the RcmdrPlugin.survival package, which has just been
made available on CRAN. The package provides an R Commander plug-in for the
survival package, with dialogs for Cox models, parametric survival
regression models, estimation of survival curves, and testing for
differences in survival curves, along with data-management facilities and a
variety of tests, diagnostics and graphs. All of this is tightly integrated
with the standard R Commander menus. 

As does the Rcmdr, the package takes advantage of the R facilities for
translating messages into other languages. It comes with a translation into
Brazilian Portuguese, courtesy of Marilia S? Carvalho of FIOCRUZ in Rio de
Janeiro, whose suggestions during the development of the package were
invaluable. Please contact me if you're interested in providing a
translation into another language.

Reports of bugs and other problems are welcome, as are suggestions for
extending the package.

Regards,
 John

Message-ID: <f8e6ff050902250521k4f5421fav8f86e0101a1c2a98@mail.gmail.com>

ggplot2 ------------------------------------------------------------

ggplot2 is a plotting system for R, based on the grammar of graphics,
which tries to take the good parts of base and lattice graphics and
avoid bad parts. It takes care of many of the fiddly details
that make plotting a hassle (like drawing legends) as well as
providing a powerful model of graphics that makes it easy to produce
complex multi-layered graphics.

Find out more at http://had.co.nz/ggplot2, and check out the nearly 500
examples of ggplot in use.  If you're interested, you can also sign up to
the ggplot2 mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/ggplot2, or track
development at http://github.com/hadley/ggplot2

ggplot2 0.8.2  (2008-02-23)
----------------------------------------

New features

* borders, fortify.map and map_data to make it easier to draw map
borders and choropleth maps

* cut_interval and cut_number utility functions to discretise
continuous variables

* stat_summary has reparameterised to make it easier to specify
different summary functions.  It now has four parameters: fun.y,
fun.ymin and fun.ymax; and fun.data.  See the documentation for
stat_summary for more details

Minor improvements

* ggfluctuation: default to aspect ratio that produces squares
* ggsave: filename now first parameter, not second
* qplot: if sample aesthetic is used, stat automatically set to qq
* scale_datetime: improved breaks calculation
* scale_gradient: better default colour scheme from red to blue
(thanks to Charlotte Wickham for providing the Munsell colours)
* scale_size and scale_area: increased default size range
* stats: all give useful error message if missing a required aesthetic
* theme_set warns if missing needed theme elements
* theme_text: now possible to right and left align text with hjust=0
and hjust=1 respectively

Bug fixes

* be explicit about plyr::is.discrete to avoid clash with Hmisc
* facet_wrap: work around R bug so no longer crashers when ncol = 1
* geom_errorbar now works correctly with dashed lines
* geom_path will now silently ignore lines with less than 2 points
(instead of throwing a mysterious error as before)
* geom_path now responds to the size aesthetic once more
* geom_polygon etc now correctly displays linetype on legends
* geom_step now works with multiple groups
* geom_vline and geom_hline: fix bug when mapping intercept to
variable in data frame
* ggsave: path parameter correctly sets path
* guides: fix broken legend from default stat aesthetics (e.g. for stat_sum)
* scale_manual now works better with missing values
* scale_manual: labels now correctly sets legend labels.
* stat_density_2d: no longer passes unnecessary parameters to kde2d
causing an error message (seen when setting aesthetics with qplot)
* stat_pointrange: better relationship between point and line widths
* stat_sum now correctly preserves other aesthetic columns (should be
a bit faster too)

Dear R Community,

I am pleased to announce that a new version of the mefa R package is
available at the CRAN.

mefa is a package for multivariate data handling in ecology and
biogeography. It provides object classes to represent the data coded
by samples, taxa and segments (i.e., subpopulations, repeated
measures). It supports easy processing of the data along with
relational data tables for samples and taxa. An object of class mefa
is a project specific compendium of the dataset and can be easily used
in further analyses. Methods are provided for extraction, aggregation,
conversion, plotting, summary and reporting of mefa objects. Reports
can be generated in plain text or LaTex.

The current version has been published in JSS (
http://www.jstatsoft.org/v29/i08 ). The paper presents worked examples
on a variety of ecological analyses.

Best wishes,

P?ter

Message-ID: <49AC214F.9040509@erasmusmc.nl>

Dear R-users,

I'd like to announce the release of the new version of package 'ltm' 
(i.e., ltm_0.9-0 soon available from CRAN) for Item Response Theory 
analyses. This package provides a flexible framework for analyzing 
dichotomous and polytomous data under various IRT models. Furthermore, 
supporting functions for descriptive statistics, goodness-of-fit, 
ability estimation and plotting are available.

New features include:

  * function gpcm() (along with supporting methods, for the generic 
functions, anova, plot, margins, factor.scores, summary, vcov) has been 
added for fitting the Generalized Partial Credit Model. The 'constraint' 
argument of gpcm() can be used to specify constrained versions of the 
model. Options are:

    - 'constraint = "rasch"' that fits the partial credit model (i.e., 
discrimination parameter fixed at one)

    - 'constraint = "1PL"' that specifies a single discrimination 
parameter, equal among items, and

    - 'constraint = "gpcm"' that specifies a different discrimination 
parameter per item.

  * gpcm() also allows for mixed type items, i.e., dichotomous and 
polytomous; however, for data sets with only dichotomous items, 
functions rasch() and ltm() are more efficient.

  * The new function GoF.gpcm() calculates the Pearson chi-squared 
statistic for Generalized Partial Credit models. A p-value can be also 
produced either using the asymptotic chi-squared distribution or a 
parametric Bootstrap approach.

  * The new function rmvordlogis() can be used to simulate ordinal data 
under the Graded Response and the Generalized Partial Credit models.

  * for more details and other new features check the NEWS file that 
ships with the package.

More information as well as *.R files illustrating the capabilities of 
the package can be found in the R-wiki page of 'ltm' available at: 
http://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php?id=packages:cran:ltm.


As always, any kind of feedback (e.g., questions, suggestions, 
bug-reports, etc.) is more than welcome.

Best,
Dimitris

Subject: [R-pkgs] New CRAN Package: WriteXLS
Message-ID: <2CD42541-06B8-499A-9A31-F341C5ED618A@me.com>

A new package called WriteXLS (Version 1.5.0), containing a single  
function of the same name, is now available via CRAN. The package is  
made available under the GPL, version >=2.

The function is based upon a Perl script that I have previously posted  
on r-help, now wrapped in R for convenience. It provides a cross- 
platform function to create Excel 2003 (XLS) files from one or more  
data frames. Each data frame will be written to a separate named  
worksheet in the Excel spreadsheet. The worksheet name will be the  
name of the data frame it contains.

The package requires that Perl and several specific Perl modules are  
installed in order to function. These modules, which may already be  
installed on systems with Perl installed, include:

   OLE::Storage_Lite
   Parse::RecDescent
   Getopt::Long
   File::Basename
   Spreadsheet::WriteExcel
   Encode
   File::Glob
   Text::CSV_XS


With the exception of the last three modules listed, for convenience  
all are included in the CRAN package and will be made available by  
adding the installed package path for these modules to the Perl @INC  
array.

The last three modules (Encode, File::Glob and Text::CSV_XS) are 'XS'  
based Perl modules, meaning that they call external C routines. Thus,  
they are not included as they require local compilation using the  
particular version of Perl installed on the user's system.

As a result, only source versions of the WriteXLS package will be made  
available. This is because the examples on the function help page will  
not run without Perl and all of these modules being available on the  
user's system. Hence the package will presently fail 'R CMD check' on  
CRAN.

For more information on installing source packages from CRAN, please  
see:

   http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Installing- 
packages

WriteXLS is being maintained using R-Forge at:

   http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/writexls

Please feel free to contact me directly with questions and comments.

Many thanks to Prof. Brian Ripley for his assistance with the testing  
of this package prior to release.

Thanks,

Marc Schwartz

Subject: [R-pkgs] data.table is on CRAN (enhanced data.frame for time series
	joins and more)
Message-ID: <B6BD106B14A14CA1BFA74D9956C560D0@ADAM>

Dear all,

The data.table package was released back in August 2008. This email is to 
publicise its existence in response to several suggestions to do so. It 
seems I didn't send a general announcement about it at the time and 
therefore perhaps, not surprisingly, not many people know about it. Glancing 
at some r-help threads recently supports the idea of sending a public 
announcement.

The main difference between data.frame and data.table is enhanced 
functionality in [.data.table where most documentation for this package 
lives i.e. help("[.data.table").  Selected extracts from the package 
documentation follow.

The package builds on base R functionality to reduce 2 types of time :
   1. programming time (easier to write, read, debug and maintain)
   2. compute time
when combining database like operations (subset, with and by) and provides 
similar joins that merge provides but faster. This is achieved by using R's 
column based ordered in-memory data.frame, eval within the environment of a 
list (i.e. with), the [.data.table mechanism to condense the features and 
compiled C to make certain operations fast.

[.data.table is like [.data.frame but i and j can be expressions of column 
names directly. Furthermore i may itself be a data.table which invokes a 
fast table join using binary search in O(log n) time. Allowing i to be 
data.table is consistent with subsetting an n-dimension array by an n-column 
matrix in base R. data.tables do not have rownames but may instead have a 
key of one or more columns using setkey. This key may be used for row 
indexing instead of rownames.

Examples comparing [.data.frame and [.data.table :

DF = data.frame(a=1:5, b=6:10)
DT = data.table(a=1:5, b=6:10)

tt = subset(DF,a==3)
ss = DT[a==3]        # just use the column name 'a' directly. No need to 
remember the comma. The i argument is like the 'where' in SQL.
identical(as.data.table(tt), ss)

tt = with(subset(DF,a==3),a+b+1)
ss = DT[a==3,a+b+1]        # j is like select in SQL and the select argument 
of subset in base R.  j can be an expression of column names directly, 
including a data.table of multiple expressions.  Here the j expression is 
executed just for the rows matching the i argument.
identical(tt, ss)

# Examples above use vector scans i.e. the "a==3" expression first creates a 
logical vector as long as the total number of rows and then evaluates a==3 
for every row.
# Examples below use binary search, invoked by passing in a data.table as 
the i argument. Joins in SQL are performed in the where clause and the i 
argument is like where, so this seems very natural (to me anyway!)

DT = data.table(a=letters[1:5], b=6:10)
setkey(DT,a)
identical(DT[J("d")], DT[4])        # binary search to row for 'd'

DT = data.table(id=rep(c("A","B"),each=3), 
date=c(20080501L,20080502L,20080506L), v=1:6)
setkey(DT,id,date)
DT["A"]                                        # all 3 rows for A since mult 
by default is "all"

Thanks to all those who have made suggestions and feedback so far. Further 
comments and feedback on the package would be much appreciated.

Subject: [R-pkgs] WriteXLS: New version 1.6.0 - Binary CRAN packages
 available and other changes
Message-ID: <0BE7FC8E-7AF9-4D8C-B8AC-6DC1AA6F3C7A@me.com>

Hi all,

A new version of the WriteXLS package, 1.6.0, is making its way around  
the CRAN mirrors and should be generally available in the next 24-48  
hours.

The WriteXLS package provides a cross-platform perl based R function  
to create Excel (XLS) files from one or more data frames. Each data  
frame will be written to a separate named worksheet in the Excel  
spreadsheet. The worksheet name will be the name of the data frame it  
contains.

Key changes from version 1.5.0:

1. Thanks to work by Uwe Ligges and changes to the examples being  
used, Windows and OSX binary versions of the package will become  
available to enable their easier installation using install.packages()  
within an R session.

2. A new function called testPerl() has been added to enable the self- 
checking of the user's system to ensure that Perl and all required  
Perl modules are available to use the WriteXLS() function. The package  
will return either success or error messages indicating missing  
requirements. If you are unsure as to whether or not you have all  
requirements, you can run this function prior to using the WriteXLS()  
function.

3. A new INSTALL file has been created and is in the main package  
installation directory. An online copy is also available from CRAN at:

   http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WriteXLS/INSTALL

The INSTALL file contains additional information on the package  
requirements and recommendations for meeting them. Details are  
provided for Windows, OSX and Linux relative to options for installing  
Perl and any missing modules.

The WriteXLS package is being maintained on R-Forge at:

   https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/writexls/

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Subject: [R-pkgs] New R graphics package targeting HTML 5 canvas element
Message-ID: <49D61338.4000203@vanderbilt.edu>

Hi,

canvas is a new R package implementing a graphics device that emits 
javascript code conforming to the HTML 5 CanvasRenderingContext2D 
interface. Available on CRAN soon, but you can get it here immediately:

http://www.rforge.net/canvas

If you have access to a beta web browser like Firefox 3.1 or later, you 
can see example plots here:

http://www.rforge.net/canvas/plots/index.html

Clicking on one of the plots will take you to a comparator page where 
the plot is rendered twice, once with the canvas package and once with 
the png(type='cairo') function.

The implementation is almost complete, however there are some parts that 
need work like font metrics and dotted/dashed lines. If anyone is 
interested in helping flesh out the remaining bits, I'd be much obliged.

Best,

Jeff

Subject: [R-pkgs] [ANN] plyr version 0.1.7
Message-ID: <f8e6ff050904151646g40db1550i6ca7ac7587b90992@mail.gmail.com>

plyr is a set of tools for a common set of problems: you need to break
down a big data structure into manageable pieces, operate on each
piece and then put all the pieces back together.  For example, you
might want to:

  * fit the same model to subsets of a data frame
  * quickly calculate summary statistics for each group
  * perform group-wise transformations like scaling or standardising
  * eliminate for-loops in your code

It's already possible to do this with built-in functions (like split
and the apply functions), but plyr just makes it all a bit easier
with:

  * absolutely consistent names, arguments and outputs
  * input from and output to data.frames, matrices and lists
  * progress bars to keep track of long running operations
  * built-in error recovery, and informative error messages

Some considerable effort has been put into making plyr fast and memory
efficient, and in most cases it is faster than the built-in functions.

You can find out more at http://had.co.nz/plyr/, including a 20 page
introductory guide, http://had.co.nz/plyr/plyr-intro.pdf.  You can ask
questions about plyr (and data-manipulation in general) on the plyr
mailing list.  Sign up at http://groups.google.com/group/manipulatr


plyr 0.1.7 (2008-04-15) ---------------------------------------------------

Ensure that rbind.fill preserves attributes.

plyr 0.1.6 (2008-04-15) ---------------------------------------------------

Improvements:

* all ply functions deal more elegantly when given function names: can
supply a vector of function names, and name is used as label in output
* failwith and each now work with function names as well as functions
(i.e. "nrow" instead of nrow)
* each now accepts a list of functions or a vector of function names
* l*ply will use list names where present
* if .inform is TRUE, error messages will give you information about
where errors within your data - hopefully this will make problems
easier to track down

Speed-ups

* massive speed ups for splitting large arrays
* fixed typo that was causing a 50% speed penalty for d*ply
* rewritten rbind.fill is considerably (> 4x) faster for many data frames
* colwise about twice as fast

Bug fixes:

* daply: now works when the data frame is split by multiple variables
* aaply: now works with vectors
* ddply: first variable now varies slowest as you'd expect


plyr 0.1.5 (2008-02-23) ---------------------------------------------------

* colwise now accepts a quoted list as its second argument.  This
allows you to specify the names of columns to work on: colwise(mean,
.(lat, long))
* d_ply and a_ply now correctly pass ... to the function

Message-ID: <554cd6450904161444r3a4f74a4wb8f3dd07e47eec10@mail.gmail.com>

Dear useRs,

The FD package is intended for ecologists interested in functional
diversity (FD). It measures different functional diversity indices
from multiple traits (any type of traits). The first version of FD
(1.0-0) is now available on CRAN:

http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FD/

The main functions of FD are:

dbFD: Compute different multidimensional FD indices

gowdis: Gower dissimilarity, including options for variable weights,
asymetric binary variables, and implementing Podani's (1999) extension
to ordinal variables

fdisp: Functional dispersion

functcomp: Functional composition (community-weighted means ot trait
values, or CWM)

I hope that FD will be useful to you. Feedback would be appreciated.

Sincerely,

Etienne Lalibert?

Message-ID: <d70c15d40904180218v3d452e29j34b89f109889a8fd@mail.gmail.com>

igraph is a package for graphs/networks. It has a C core and
uses a simple and fast graph representation allowing millions
of vertices and edges.

Release notes for the 0.5.2 version:
http://igraph.sourceforge.net/relnotes-0.5.2.html

Release notes for the 0.5.1 version:
http://igraph.sourceforge.net/relnotes-0.5.1.html

Complete list of changes:
http://igraph.sourceforge.net/news.html

The igraph homepage: http://igraph.sf.net

Since there was no announcement about igraph version 0.5.1
on R-pkgs, here is a list of the more important new things of both
version 0.5.2 and 0.5.1.

NEW FEATURES IN THE 0.5.2 VERSION

- We have some support for bipartite (two-mode) graphs now.
  See ?graph.incidence, ?get.incidence for dealing with
  incidence matrices, ?graph.bipartite for a way to
  create bipartite graphs, ?bipartite.projection for
  creating one-mode projections. See ?is.bipartite for
  deciding whether a graph has a bipartite structure.
- A new simple and fast community finding algorithm called 'label
  propagation' was added, see ?label.propagation.community
  for details.
- The DrL layout generator now supports 3d layouts.
- A limited Tcl/Tk igraph GUI was added, please note that it supports
  only a small fraction of the igraph functions. You can start it with
  the tkigraph() function.
- Johnson's algorithm is now supported by the shortest path finder.
  It allows negative edge weight, but not negative cycles.
  See ?shortest.paths.
- The graph.knn function was added to calculate the average
  nearest neighbor degree. It supports edge weights as well.
- Curved edges are now supported by plot() and tkplot(), see
  ?igraph.plotting for the details.
- Many bugs and memory leaks were fixed, see the News section on the
  igraph homepage for details.

NEW FEATURES IN THE 0.5.1 VERSION

- DrL layout generator was added, see ?layout.drl.
- Uniform sampling of graphs with a given degree sequence,
  see ?degree.sequence.game.
- Conversion functions to/from graphNEL objects (graph package),
  see ?igraph.to.graphNEL and ?igraph.from.graphNEL.
- Conversion functions to/from sparse matrices (Matrix package),
  see ?graph.adjacency and the 'sparse' argument of
  ?get.adjacency.
- Creating graphs from adjacency lists, see ?graph.adjlist.
- The function graph.data.frame has an argument called
  'vertices' and this makes it very easy to create graphs
  with a lot of vertex and edge metadata.
- The Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithms
  were added, see ?shortest.paths.
- The function is.mutual() was added, this tests edge reciprocity.
- The plot() function now supports plottings different vertex
  shapes. See ?igraph.plotting and ?igraph.vertex.shapes for
  detaills.
- Many bugs were fixed, see the News section on the igraph
  homepage for details.

PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:

igraph is originally a C library for graphs, but has interfaces
to high level languages like R, Python and Ruby. The R package
contains BOTH the C library and its R interface.

igraph supports:

- graph generators, creating both regular structures like trees,
  lattices, etc. and various random graphs.
- a rich set of functions calculating structural properties of
  graphs, like vertex centrality (degree, betweenness, closeness,
  page rank, eigenvector centrality, Burt's constraints, etc.),
  shortest paths, dyad and triad census, network motifs, girth,
  K-core decomposition, etc.
- attributes can be associated with the vertices/edges of the graph,
  or the graph itself. The attributes can be arbitrary R objects.
- graph visualization using regular R devices, interactive visualization
  using Tcl/Tk, 3D visualization using RGL.
- graph layout generators, the standard Kamada-Kawai and
  Fruchterman-Reingold algorithms are included, plus many more.
- Functions for graph and subgraph isomorphism, the BLISS and the VF2
  algorithms are included.
- Functions for maximal network flows, minimal cuts, vertex and
  edge connectivity.
- igraph can read and write many popular file formats used for
  storing graph data: GraphML, Pajek, GML and others.
- igraph contains implementations of many community structure
  detection algorithms proposed recently.

Subject: [R-pkgs] xterm256
Message-ID: <49EC2B17.7030107@dbmail.com>

This is the first release of the xterm256 package.

xterm256 is a small package that takes advantage of the 256 color mode 
of xterm, enabling use of foreground and background colors in the R 
console. The package exposes one function "style" that takes three 
arguments:
- (x) the text to style
- (bg) the background color to use
- (fg) the foreground color to use

The color might be specified as an number between 0 and 255 (see 
http://frexx.de/xterm-256-notes/), as classic hex notation ( "#ff0000" ) 
or as an R color ("red"). Note that the color specified is mapped to the 
closest color of the 256 colors using an euclidean distance in the RGB 
space.

The package is maintained at r-forge as part of the highlight project: 
http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/highlight/ and welcomes requests 
(feature requests, bug requests, ...) though its tracker : 
http://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/?group_id=384

Below you find a list of major improvements in version 2.1:

%---------------------------------------------
SweaveListingUtils:
%---------------------------------------------
  + a new package devoted to joining markup provided by TeX package
      'listings' with Sweave;
  + also covers inclusion of code sniplets from an url
     (notably r-forge) in order to ease consistency
      of documentation with code that is being developed.
    see also ?lstinputSourceFromRForge and

       Following Peter Dalgaard's hint
         https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2008-September/174295.html
       we use the log.p argument to be able to simulate accurately from
       the far out tails.
  + refined collapsing technique for DiscreteDistribution
  + more frequent use of FFT for convolution by better treatment of
      joint lattices
  AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF IMAGE DISTRIBUTION

Message-ID: <f8e6ff050904201821r22a30dcfp6d9dbbd521cdfcd0@mail.gmail.com>

ggplot2 ------------------------------------------------------------

ggplot2 is a plotting system for R, based on the grammar of graphics,
which tries to take the good parts of base and lattice graphics and
avoid bad parts. It takes care of many of the fiddly details
that make plotting a hassle (like drawing legends) as well as
providing a powerful model of graphics that makes it easy to produce
complex multi-layered graphics.

To install or update, run:
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "plyr"))

Find out more at http://had.co.nz/ggplot2, and check out the nearly 500
examples of ggplot in use.  If you're interested, you can also sign up to
the ggplot2 mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/ggplot2, or track
development at  http://github.com/hadley/ggplot2

ggplot2 0.8.3  (2008-04-20)
----------------------------------------

New features

* alpha: new aesthetic, with scale alpha.  Where a geom has both fill
and colour, alpha affects the fill.
* annotate: new annotate function to make it easier to add annotations to plots
* facet_grid now takes strip label function from parameter labeller,
not theme setting
* facet_grid: gains as.table argument to control direction of horizontal facets
* fortify: full set of methods for turning data from the sp package
into data frames that can be plotted with ggplot2
* geom_errorbarh: new geom for horizontal error bars
* labels_parsed and labels_bquote functions to make it easier to
display expressions on facet labels
* scale_manual now supports breaks and limits
* subset: experimental new feature.  Layers now have a subset
argument, which takes subsets formatted like .(var1 < 5, var2 == 3)
etc.
* xlim and ylim now work recognise Date and POSIXct classes to create
date and date_time scales respectively

Dealing with missing values

* facet_wrap: add drop argument to control whether or not panels for
non-existent combinations of facetting variables should be dropped or
not.  Defaults to TRUE
* scale_discrete: empty factor levels will be preserved, unless drop = TRUE

Bug fixes

* added presidents dataset from book to package
* American spelling of color accepted in as geom parameter, and all
colour scales have alias spelled color (e.g. scale_color_hue)
* facet_wrap: contents guaranteed to be clipped to panel
* facet_wrap: corrected labelling when facetting by multiple variables
(thank to Charlotte Wickham for a clear test case)
* geom_histogram now works with negative weights (provided position =
"identity").  This is useful for creating back to back histograms.
* geom_step: improve legend
* geom_text: better legend
* geom_vline, geom_hline, geom_abline: should work in yet more situations
* resolution: fixed bug in computation of resolution that lead to
(e.g.) incorrect boxplot widths when there was only a single x value
in a group.
* position_stack: fixed bug in detection of overlap for very large bins
* scale_discrete: factor levels no longer mistakenly reordered
* scale_hue: now spans full range of hue if it less than 360 degrees
* scale_hue: rotated default hue range by 15 degrees to avoid
unfortunate red-green contrast in two colour case
* show now works with ggplot objects
* stat_sum: fixed bug which resulted in dropped aesthetics
* stat_summary: now warns when dropping records with missing values
* stat_summary: should be a little faster
* stat_summary: correctly passes ... arguments on fun.data
* theme_bw: corrected justification of axis.text.y
* trans: bug fixes to logistic transformation
* order aesthetic should work again

The TraMineR package for mining, describing and visualizing sequences of 
states or events, and more generally discrete sequential data has been 
updated to version 1.2. Its primary aim is the analysis of biographical 
longitudinal data in the social sciences, such as data describing 
careers or family trajectories. Most of its features apply however also 
to non temporal data such as text or DNA sequences for instance. These are

   * Handling of longitudinal data and conversion between various 
sequence formats
   * Plotting sequences (density plot, frequency plot, index plot and more)
   * Centro-type and heterogeneity measure of a set of sequences
   * Individual longitudinal characteristics of sequences (length, time 
in each state, longitudinal entropy, turbulence and more)
   * Sequence transversal characteristics by age point (transversal 
state distribution, transversal entropy, modal state)
   * Other aggregated characteristics (transition rates, average 
duration in each state, sequence frequency)
   * Dissimilarities between pairs of sequences using several metric 
(Optimal matching, longest common prefix, longest common postfix, 
longest common subsequence)
   * ANOVA-like analysis of sequences and tree structured ANOVA from 
dissimilarities
   * Extracting frequent event subsequences
   * Identifying most discriminating event subsequences

More information about TraMineR can be found  here:

Cheers,
The TraMineR team.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package: CHNOSZ
Message-ID: <49F24C42.1070905@asu.edu>

Dear R users,

A new package, CHNOSZ (version 0.8), is available on CRAN.

CHNOSZ is a package for thermodynamic calculations and analysis. 
Functions are available for calculating the standard Gibbs energies and 
other thermodynamic properties, and chemical affinities, of reactions 
between species contained in the thermodynamic database. The database 
includes standard thermodynamic properties and equations of state 
parameters for a variety of minerals and inorganic and organic aqueous 
species. The relative abundances of species in equilibrium can be drawn 
on activity diagrams as a function of temperature, pressure and/or 
chemical activities of basis species.

The documentation includes many examples taken from the literature, as 
well as calculations of the metastability relationships in systems of 
proteins. The protein examples were developed to explore the chemical 
features of thermophilic adaptation, subcellular localization, proteomic 
stress response, and microbial diversity. Calculation of the standard 
Gibbs energies of proteins is based on a published group additivity 
algorithm and is further supported in this package by the inclusion of 
data files for the amino acid compositions of selected proteins and of 
proteins in yeast and E. coli.

A paper describing some applications of the package can be found in 
Geochemical Transactions:

http://www.geochemicaltransactions.com/content/9/1/10

The project website highlights many of the example calculations. There 
is also an Rpad script available for download that presents basic 
functionality of the program in a browser interface. The website is 
located at:

http://www.chnosz.net

This release offers major enhancements over previous versions available 
on the project website. Chemical affinities of formation reactions can 
be calculated as a function of more than two variables, parallel 
processing of some computations is optionally carried out using the 
mclapply function of the multicore package, amino acid compositions of 
proteins can be read from FASTA files, protein stress response and 
richness calculations were added to the examples, and a mass transfer 
algorithm for reaction path modeling has been introduced.

Feedback about the package is appreciated.

Sincerely,

Jeff Dick

Subject: [R-pkgs] frontier 0.99 is NOT backward compatible
Message-ID: <200905042045.00741.arne.henningsen@googlemail.com>

Dear current (and future) users of the "frontier" package,

We are approaching the first stable version (1.0) of the frontier package, 
which provides tools for microeconomic Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). 
I have uploaded a kind of beta release (version 0.99) of this package to CRAN. 
The most important differences to version 0.9 affect the user interface. I 
have modified the package so that it is (hopefully) simpler to use and the 
functions are more similar to other R functions. Unfortunately, these changes 
make the new version NOT backward compatible. The most significant changes are 
reported below. A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN 
repository on R-Forge [1]. Feedback about this package is highly appreciated. 
Please report any bugs, suggestions, feature requests, comments, and questions 
in the forums and trackers on R-Forge [1].

[1] http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/frontier/

Best regards,
Arne


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99-0

* corrected and considerably improved documentation of function "fontier"

* changed order of arguments of function "frontier"

* removed arguments "crossSectionName" and "timePeriodName" from function
"frontier": in case of cross-section data, these variables (information) are
not needed, and in case of panel data, the information on the panel structure
has to be added to the data set by the function "plm.data" of the "plm" 
package

* argument "modelType" of function "frontier" must be "ECF" or "EEF" now

* replaced argument "funtionType" of function "frontier"
by argument "ineffDecrease"

* renamed argument "eta" of function "frontier" as "timeEffect"

* split argument "mu" of function "frontier" into "truncNorm"
and "zIntercept"

* increased default value of argument "maxit" of function "frontier" to 1000

* renamed argument "step1" of function "frontier" as "searchStep"

* renamed argument "tol2" of function "frontier" as "searchTol"

* replaced argument "indic" of function "frontier" by "searchScale"

* renamed argument "gridno" of function "frontier" as "gridSize"

* renamed argument "igrid2" of function "frontier" as "gridDouble"

* renamed argument "iprint" of function "frontier" as "printIter"

* removed arguments "qxNames" and "quadHalf" from function "frontier",
because quadratic or translog frontiers can be estimated with function
"frontierQuad" now

* added "logLik" method for objects of class "frontier"

* added function "frontierQuad" for estimating quadratic and translog 
frontiers

* added function "frontierTranslogRay" for estimating stochastic ray
translog frontier functions

* added the generic function "efficiencies" and corresponding methods
for default objects and objects of class "frontier"

* added "elas" method for objects of class "frontierQuad"

* function frontier() and frontierQuad() return the (matched) call now

* the matrix of efficiency estimates returned by "frontier" has row names
(cross section units) and possibly column names (time period) now

Message-ID: <0A5A4124-CF2B-4661-91D4-94A244CEC518@act.ulaval.ca>

Dear useRs,

A new version of actuar is available since last Friday. This is mainly  
a bugfix release. From the NEWS file:

Version 1.0-2
=============

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

o m<foo>() and lev<foo>() now return Inf instead of NaN for infinite
moments. (Thanks to David Humke for the idea.)

BUG FIXES

o Non-ascii characters in one R source file prevented compilation of
the package in a C locale (at least on OS X).

o For probability laws that have a strictly positive mode or a mode
at zero depending on the value of one or more shape parameters,
d<foo>(0, ...) did not handle correctly the case exactly at the
boundary condition.

actuar is a package offering additional actuarial science  
functionality to R, mostly in the fields of loss distributions, risk  
theory (including ruin theory), simulation of compound hierarchical  
models and credibility theory

Message-ID: <68e086180905200347sb72adf4x7734169f64bc024f@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

The "tractor.base" package has recently been added to CRAN. This
package provides functions to read, write, visualise and manipulate
magnetic resonance images. The standard Analyze, NIfTI and DICOM file
formats are supported (read-only for DICOM), and all metadata is
stored with the image data internally. The code can be used to
visualise image slices or maximum intensity projections; and to apply
masking, thresholding or other arbitrary functions to the image data.
The package is written in pure R.

This package stands alone, but it is also part of the larger TractoR
project for working with MR images and diffusion MR based
tractography. Further information about TractoR can be found at
<http://code.google.com/p/tractor>.

Regards,
Jon

Message-ID: <4A284574.1000408@ucla.edu>

Hi,

With the help of Dirk Eddelbuettel, I was able to fix a few little 
problems that prevented the rimage (0.5-7) package from working under 
(at least) R 2.8 or 2.9 and g++ 4.2 or 4.3.  I have uploaded a new 
release, 0.5-8, that fixes these problems. 

It have attempted to contact the package's  maintainer, Tomomi TAKASHINA 
<t.takashina at computer.org>, to no avail.   Kurt Hornik has also not been 
able to make contact with Tomomi. 

At Kurt's suggestion, I have changed the maintainer to "ORPHANED."

Best,

Jeff Lewis

Changes since version 1.7.1:

Added a new argument "Encoding" to WriteXLS(). The argument enables the
proper decoding of data in the package's WriteXLS.pl Perl script for
either "UTF-8" (default) or "latin1" character sets. Previously only
UTF-8 was supported. This is modeled after the Encoding() R function.

Thanks to Robert Burns for reporting the problem and testing the fix.

Subject: [R-pkgs] package JM -- version 0.3-0
Message-ID: <4A3B47C7.60508@erasmusmc.nl>

Dear R-users,

I'd like to announce the release of the new version of package JM (soon 
available from CRAN) for the joint modelling of longitudinal and 
time-to-event data using shared parameter models. These models are 
applicable in mainly two settings. First, when focus is in the 
time-to-event outcome and we wish to account for the effect of a 
time-dependent covariate measured with error. Second, when focus is in 
the longitudinal outcome and we wish to correct for nonrandom dropout.

New features include:

   * a relative risk model with a piecewise-constant baseline risk 
function is now available for the event outcome, using option 
'piecewise-PH-GH' in the 'method' argument of jointModel().

   * several types of residuals are supported for the longitudinal and 
time-to-event outcomes. Moreover, for the longitudinal outcome there is 
also the option to compute multiple-imputation-based residuals, as 
described in Rizopoulos, Verbeke and Molenberghs (Biometrics 2009, to 
appear).

   * the Weibull submodel for the time-to-event outcome is now available 
under both the relative risk and accelerated failure time formulations.

   * this new version of the package features new and more robust 
algorithms for numerical integration and optimization -- these updates 
could lead to different results, epsecially for the survival part 
compared to the previous version the package.


As always, any kind of feedback (e.g., questions, suggestions, 
bug-reports, etc.) is more than welcome.

Best,
Dimitris

Message-ID: <f8e6ff050906230836k58d07d09k61da10fe4eb2c475@mail.gmail.com>

plyr is a set of tools for a common set of problems: you need to break
down a big data structure into manageable pieces, operate on each
piece and then put all the pieces back together.  For example, you
might want to:

  * fit the same model to subsets of a data frame
  * quickly calculate summary statistics for each group
  * perform group-wise transformations like scaling or standardising
  * eliminate for-loops in your code

It's already possible to do this with built-in functions (like split
and the apply functions), but plyr just makes it all a bit easier
with:

  * absolutely consistent names, arguments and outputs
  * input from and output to data.frames, matrices and lists
  * progress bars to keep track of long running operations
  * built-in error recovery, and informative error messages

Some considerable effort has been put into making plyr fast and memory
efficient, and in most cases it is faster than the built-in functions.

You can find out more at http://had.co.nz/plyr/, including a 20 page
introductory guide, http://had.co.nz/plyr/plyr-intro.pdf.  You can ask
questions about plyr (and data-manipulation in general) on the plyr
mailing list.  Sign up at http://groups.google.com/group/manipulatr

plyr 0.1.9 (2009-06-23) ---------------------------------------------------

* fix bug in rbind.fill when NULLs present in list
* improve each to recognise when all elements are numeric
* fix labelling bug in d*ply when .drop = FALSE
* additional methods for quoted objects
* add summarise helper - this function is like transform, but creates
a new data frame rather than reusing the old (thanks to Brendan
O'Connor for the neat idea)

Message-ID: <4A409812.3080007@dbmail.com>

Hello,

I've uploaded the initial release (0.0-142) of the RImageJ package to CRAN.
The package allows R to use the facilities of the java based image 
processing and analysis platform ImageJ.

See also the announcement on my blog, with a very simple example showing 
how to use the package:
http://romainfrancois.blog.free.fr/index.php?post/2009/06/22/using-ImageJ-from-R%3A-the-RImageJ-package 


The package is currently very simple (5 lines of R code !) but 
additional features (such as an implementation of the java graphics 
device on top of imagej) are planned.

Message-ID: <alpine.LFD.2.00.0906250952560.5639@gannet.stats.ox.ac.uk>

Version 1.2.6 of RODBC is now on CRAN.  This has a number of bug fixes and many 
workarounds for ODBC driver quirks--I've set up further testbeds for SQL Server 
2008, Oracle and DB2.

More visibly, the documentation has been expanded in several ways, in 
particular in collecting together advice on using 'schemas' and 'catalogs' in 
the ?RODBC overview.

There is also a test suite which although mainly useful for the maintainer 
provides some more detailed examples of working with the quirks of various 
backends (and has examples for Oracle's own Windows ODBC driver). 
Contributions of adaptations of those examples to other drivers would be 
welcome (especially for Sybase and other ODBC drivers for Oracle).

In the next version much of the documentation will be moved from the help pages 
to a package manual: a draft of that manual appropriate to RODBC 1.2-6 can be 
found at http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/RODBC-manual.pdf

Other planned changes are speed-ups for Oracle (currently 4x on the test 
suite), more support for schemas (that in 1.2-6 is just a first step, but the 
behaviour of the ODBC drivers is remarkably inconsistent) and support for R's 
'raw' type.

Subject: [R-pkgs] WriteXLS - New Version 1.8.1
Message-ID: <8986526B-E4B4-46F1-9E92-003DD0CCDDA5@me.com>

The updated package has been submitted to CRAN and will propagate to  
mirrors over the next day or so.

It is maintained on R-Forge at http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/writexls 
, where downloads will be available as well. There is a transient  
problem at the moment with R-Forge and the build system, so there may  
be delays using R-Forge to get the updated package builds.

Package: WriteXLS

Version: 1.8.1

Description: Cross-platform perl based R function to create Excel  
(XLS) files from one or more data frames. Each data frame will be  
written to a separate named worksheet in the Excel spreadsheet. The  
worksheet name will be the name of the data frame it contains or can  
be specified by the user.

Author(s): Marc Schwartz <marc_schwartz at me.com>
Maintainer: Marc Schwartz <marc_schwartz at me.com>

License: GPL (>=2)


Changes since version 1.8.0:

The data frames will be written to the Excel file in the order that  
they appear in 'x'. Note that this is a change in the default  
behavior, where due to Perl's file globbing, they would previously  
have been written in alpha sort order. The prior default behavior  
could result in a mis-match between the data frames written to the  
Excel worksheets and the user specified worksheet names as indicated  
in the 'SheetNames' argument (added recently in version 1.7.1), if  
present.

As a result of the above change, File::Glob is no longer used and has  
been removed as a required Perl module for the package. References to  
File::Glob have been removed from the testPerl() function and all  
supporting files.

The INSTALL file has been copied to the 'inst' package folder, so that  
it is installed in the main package directory. It will therefore be  
available both on the CRAN mirror page for the package and on the  
user's system as referenced in the help files.

Subject: [R-pkgs] new version of package deSolve on CRAN
Message-ID: <4A48DF98.9070403@tu-dresden.de>

Dear R users,

an improved version of package deSolve (version 1.3) is now available on
CRAN. deSolve, the successor of R package odesolve, is a package to
solve initial value problems (IVP) of:

- ordinary differential equations (ODE),
- differential algebraic equations (DAE) and
- partial differential equations (PDE).

The implementation includes stiff integration routines based on the
ODEPACK Fortran codes (Hindmarsh 1983). It also contains fixed and
adaptive time step Runge-Kutta solvers and the Euler method.


Main improvements:

- new introductory tutorial (vignette) "Solving initial value
differential equations in R",

- all integrators are now implemented in compiled languages (Fortran
resp. C). Now all solvers allow to call compiled models directly (see
package vignette "Writing Code in Compiled Language").

- new function ode.3d that supplements the already existing
ode.1d and ode.2d,

- new function "diagnostics",

- many small improvements, especially of the documentation.


Have fun!

Thomas Petzoldt, Karline Soetaert, Woodrow Setzer

Subject: [R-pkgs] Parallel programming packages iterators,
	foreach and doMC released
Message-ID: <475a3c8f0907010945p13e52b2am299cbf2c27fe43a9@mail.gmail.com>

REvolution Computing has just released three new packages for R to
CRAN (under the open-source Apache 2.0 license): foreach, iterators,
and doMC. Together, they provide a simple, scalable parallel computing
framework for R that lets you take advantage of your multicore or
multiprocessor workstation to program loops that run faster than
traditional loops in R.

The three packages build on each other to implement a new loop
construct for R -- foreach -- where iterations may run in parallel on
separate cores or processors.

"iterators" implements the iterator object familiar to users of
languages like Java, C# and Python to make it easy to program useful
sequences - from all the prime numbers to the columns of a matrix or
the rows of an external database. Iterators objects are used as the
index variable for the parallel loops.

"foreach" builds on the "iterators" package to introduce a new way of
programming loops in R. Unlike the traditional for loop, a foreach
loop can run multiple iterations simultaneously, in parallel. If you
only have a single-processor machine, foreach runs iterations
sequentially. But with a multiprocessor workstation and a connection
to a parallel programming backend, multiple iterations of the loop
will run in parallel. This means that without any changes to your
code, the loop will run faster (and with a speedup scaled by the
number of available cores or processors, potentially much faster).

"doMC" provides such a link between "foreach" and a parallel
programming backend -- in this case, the multicore package (from Simon
Urbanek). With this connection, foreach loops on MacOS and Unix/Linux
systems will make use of all the available cores/processors on the
local workstation to run iterations in parallel.

Subject: [R-pkgs] SweaveListingUtils --- a package for joining markup
 provided by TeX package 'listings' with Sweave
Message-ID: <4A4C7B3B.2050602@web.de>

As indicated in some off-list mail by Frank E. Harrell Jr.,
the announcement of the availability of package

%---------------------------------------------
SweaveListingUtils
%---------------------------------------------

on CRAN, mingled into mail "New versions for the distr-family of
packages" to R-pkgs from 21 Apr 2009, will probably have gone
unnoticed by some people who might be interested in this package.

Briefly, SweaveListingUtils provides utilities to make accessible
the markup commands provided by TeX package 'listings' (Heinz and Moses
(2007)) for use with Sweave (confer Leisch(2002a,b,2003).

R-functions for setting R-markup in Sweave by means of 'listings'
command \lstset are defined. (lstsetR, lstsetRd)

R-Comments will automatically be set in a different style using
\lstset- resp. lstsetR()- argument 'commentstyle'.

Different coloring for input, output and comments is set by default.

.Rd markup is defined as a new "sublanguage" of TeX for listings package.

Perhaps most useful is a feature for automatic keyword registration
to listings for markup: We dynamically create a list of such keywords
by masking/extending commands require(), library() such that, in
addition to the usual behavior, these commands after attaching package
SweaveListingUtils issue TeX (or more specifically listings) code
registering for markup all keywords found by ls() in the search() list;
besides this side effect require(), library() should behave as usual.
This way, each package can have its own markup style which can be useful
to highlight ones own new functions in a different way.

Finally, SweaveListingUtils also covers inclusion of code
sniplets from a repository / an url (notably/by default from r-forge).
This can help to include R code from source files in some package
R folder to be consistently documented in some vignette.

For details you may wish to consider  ?lstinputSourceFromRForge
and vignette "ExampleSweaveListingUtils".

I'd look forward to receiving questions, comments and
suggestions

Best,
Peter Ruckdeschel

Hi all,
After a lot of rewriting, I am happy to say that plotrix_2.6-4 is on 
CRAN. The reason I am announcing this is that the newish hierobarp 
function has had a complete rewrite. This was the result of my learning 
that the old version was horrendously slow on large data sets. Let me 
know if there are any other problems in the package. Next up - a 
function to center plot titles to the figure region on plots that are 
way off center.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Version 0.7 of package tsDyn, nonlinear time series
Message-ID: <4A6C630A.10405@gmail.com>

Hi

Version 0.7 of package tsDyn presented at useR! 2009  is now on CRAN, 
extended with several new features.

The package tsDyn is aimed at estimating nonlinear time series models 
which exhibit regime specific properties. The regime switching dynamics 
can either be described by smooth transition (STAR and LSTAR) or 
threshold effects (SETAR). The package furthermore offers nonlinear 
models such as neural networks (NNET), and additive autoregressive (AAR) 
models.

The version 0.7 enhances the functionalities for the threshold 
autoregression models (SETAR) by extending the estimation techniques, 
providing a complete testing framework and finally allowing its use in a 
multivariate framework (generalizing VAR and VECM models).

Those new features are particularly interesting in economic applications 
as they generalize the concept of cointegration: with threshold 
cointegration, variables are still meant to share a long-run 
relationship, but their adjustment need not occur instantaneously but 
only after the deviation exceeds some critical threshold. This allows 
the model to take into account possible effects of transaction costs or 
stickiness of prices. Further, it permits us to capture asymmetries in 
the adjustment process, where positive or negative deviations are not 
corrected to the same extent.

A second vignette available at 
http://code.google.com/p/tsdyn/wiki/ThresholdCointegration offers an 
overview of the threshold cointegration framework and describes the 
implemented functions. It can serve as an ideal introduction for people 
interested in discovering this field.


Main new features include:
-added possibilty to have two thresolds and hence three regimes in setar 
and selectSETAR (arg nthresh)
-new functions for unit roots tests: KapShinTest() and BBCTest()
-new functions for estimating VAR and VECM: lineVar
-new function for estimating TVECM: function TVECM()
-new function for estimating TVAR: function TVAR()
-new function to test for setar: function setarTest()
-new function to test for TVAR: function TVAR.LRtest()
-new function to test for TVECM: functions TVECM.SeoTest() and 
HanSeo_TVECM()
-new function to simulate/bootstrap a TVAR: function TVAR.sim()
-new function to simulate/bootstrap a TVECM: function TVECM.sim()
-new function to simulate/bootstrap a setar: function setar.sim()
-new function to estimate regime-specific variance in setar: function 
resVar()
-new function to extend a bootstrap replication in setarTest: function 
extendBoot()
-added in selectSETAR() and setar() following args: include, common, 
model, trim, MM, ML, MH, model, restriction
-added in selectSETAR(): criterion "SSR" (sum of squares residual) and 
argument max.iter
-extended arg th in selectSETAR to search inside an intervall or around 
a point or on the whole grid

Note that minor fixes/improvements are expected soon, those will be only 
reported in the specific mailing list:  tsdyn at googlegroups.com

Any comments/remarks, suggestions and bug reports are sure welcome!

Message-ID: <E71B6F8FD9DA77498BED796B4E35362C01BAB6C0DC@NIHMLBX01.nih.gov>

Hi all,

I have uploaded a new package called perm which does linear permutation tests. It does two-sample, k-sample and trend tests. The package is redundant, since everything it does can be done in the coin package, and it is usually faster in coin. The main motivation is to provide another check for exact tests in R.  It also handles ties differently than coin, so if you have test statistics that theoretically should be tied but are not tied in R, perm can easily be made to treat them as tied.  The package perm rounds to the nearest 12 digits (or whatever you set the 'digits' parameter to) then calls values that match to the first 12 digits tied.

Let me know if there are comments or questions,

Thanks,

Mike

It allows Surv objects and can calculated exact p-values. It calls the perm package, but also allows calculation of scores that may be output to faster permutation packages like coin.

There is a full description of the packge and methods  in a vignette.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Deducer 0.1 : An intuitive cross-platform data analysis GUI
Message-ID: <C04B648476384BDF91C046FEEDED70B0@gpbdmx>

Deducer 0.1 has been released to CRAN

Deducer is designed to be a free, easy to use, alternative to proprietary
software such as SPSS, JMP, and Minitab. It has a menu system to do common
data manipulation and data analysis tasks, and an excel-like spreadsheet in
which to view and edit data frames. The goal of the project is to two fold. 

	1. Provide an intuitive interface so that non-technical users 
	   can learn and perform analyses without programming getting 
	   in their way. 
	2. Increase the efficiency of expert R users when performing 
         common tasks by replacing hundreds of keystrokes with a few 
         mouse clicks. Also, as much as possible the GUI should not 
         get in their way if they just want to do some programming. 

Deducer is integrated into the Windows RGui, and the cross-platform Java
console JGR, and is also usable and accessible from the command line.
Screen shots and examples can be viewed in the online wiki manual:

Dear all,

I am pleased to announce the CRAN release of a new package called 'KFAS' -
Kalman filter and smoother.

The package KFAS contains functions of multivariate Kalman filter,
smoother, simulation smoother and forecasting. It uses univariate approach
algorithm (aka sequential processing), which is faster than normal method,
and it also allows mean square prediction error matrix Ft to be singular.
Filtering, smoothing and simulation functions are all written in Fortran.
Functions allow time-variant system matrices and missing observations. In
case distributions of some or all elements of initial state vector are
unknown, functions use exact diffuse initialisation.

I hope that this package will be useful for people working with state
space models and time series in general. Any feedback is appreciated.

Yours,

Message-ID: <4AA5F87C.80808@dbmail.com>

Hello,

This is to announce the first release of the "ant" R package, which has 
been pushed to CRAN yesterday, and should reach your mirror and your 
platform soon.

The package provides an R-aware version of the famous build tool from 
the apache project. http://ant.apache.org/

The package ships an R script that can be used to invoke ant with enough 
plumbing so that it can use R specific tasks within targets.

$ Rscript -e "ant::ant()"

The package contains two R specific tasks:
- <r-run> that can be used to run arbitrary R code.
- <r-set> that can be used to set a property based on the result of an R 
expression.

An demonstrative build file is included within the package to further 
illustrate the two tasks. Also available at my blog (http://tr.im/xMdt)

R> system.file( "examples", "build.xml", package = "ant" )

The package is source-controlled at r-forge as part of the orchestra 
project. http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/orchestra/

Many thanks to Duncan Murdoch who suggested adding the "ant" function as 
a shortcut to invoke the script and Simon Urbanek who revealed to me the 
existence of the configure script.

This is a very first release, so feedback and ideas for additional 
features or tasks is very welcome.

particular, rms does not use low-level C language interfaces to other 
packages and will be easier to maintain.  rms also interfaces to 
quantile regression (new Rq function), and interfaces to glm and gls 
have been renamed Glm and Gls.  rms requires the latest version of Hmisc 
on CRAN.

rms has cleaned up graphics routines to make them more modular, to use 
lattice graphics, and to make it easier to use ggplot2 graphics. 
Defaults for confidence bands are now gray scale-shaded polygons.

The most visable change for the user is the replacement of the 
plot.Design function with the Predict, plot.Predict, and bplot 
functions.  plot.Predict is used for bivariate graphics (using lattice), 
and bplot is used for 3-d graphics using base graphics functions image, 
contour, and persp. Note that multi-panel lattice graphics are usually 
better than 3-d graphics for showing the effects of multiple predictors 
varying simultaneously. The output of Predict is suitable for direct use 
by lattice (e.g., the xyplot function) and ggplot2 if you don't want to 
use plot.Predict.  plot.Predict allows you to specify a lattice formula 
(less the left hand side) if you don't like plot.Predict's choice of 
superpositioning and panel variables.

The following outlines the most significant change users will need to 
make (the web page contains the complete list).  Note that the 
convention used for getting predictions over the default range is now 
predictor=. rather than predictor=NA.

require(rms)  # instead of Design; loads Hmisc and survival
plot(fit, x1=NA, x2=NA, ...) changed to
  p <- Predict(fit, x1=., x2=., ...)
  plot(p)          # ?plot.Predict for details; produces a lattice object
  plot(Predict(fit, ...))
  print(plot(p))   # needed if using Sweave or are inside { }

  plot(fit, .., method='image' or 'contour' or 'persp') changed to
  p <- Predict(..., np=50)   # type ?Predict for details
  bplot(p, method=)   # ?bplot for details; uses base graphics

The nomogram function now has a plot method so nomogram() by itself does 
not plot.

Type ?rmsOverview for an overview and extensive examples.  The package's 
home page contains a reference card you can print.

Message-ID: <20090909102629.5wm9t66yn6s4cwoc@imp.inserm.fr>


This is to announce a new package MLCM on CRAN.
The package provides functions for estimating perceptual scales
by maximum likelihood from data collected in a conjoint measurement
experiment. Data for conjoint measurement are typically collected
using a psychophysical procedure. The stimuli vary along 2 or more
dimensions.  The observer views pairs of stimuli and judges which
stimulus of each pair is higher on a specified dimension.
For example, stimuli may be goods baskets containing amounts of
milk and honey (dimensions) and the subject may order each pair
of baskets by subjective desirability.  This package contains
tools to estimate the additive contribution of the n scales
to the judgment by a maximum likelihood method under several
hypotheses of how the perceptual dimensions interact.

Subject: [R-pkgs] homals package and core loop
Message-ID: <7CA48FBC-953C-4A9D-9CFD-38B4054B9896@stat.ucla.edu>

The homals package

http://www.jstatsoft.org/v31/i04

will get a major programming overhaul. This will take some time,
but what's a few years on a 40-year project. Suggestions
from the audience are welcome.

homals() has a core loop over the m variables in which

1. tapply is used to compute category quantification (centroids)
2. category quantifications are then adjusted to satisfy the
   rank and level constraints

The idea is to replace 1 by least squares fitting of a B-spline and
to adjust 2 accordingly. The core will be re-programmed in C
and/or FORTRAN (sometimes using existing routines), and the loop over
variables will be parallelized using OpenMP or Grand Central Dispatch.
For ordinal variables this requires some alternative quadratic  
programming
routines to be linked in (which could then also become part of the
isotone package).

In addition the basic homals code will have object (individual) weights
(minor addition) and the prehom routines (from the jacobi package) will
be added. Because of the use of B splines the variables in homals will
no longer be all factors, some can now be numerical ("continuous").

Otherwise the package will keep its many analysis options (multi-set  
non-metric canonical analysis,
non-metric discriminant analysis, non-metric regression, multiple  
correspondence analysis,
non-metric principal components analysis, non-metric additive conjoint  
analysis)
and its many plot options.

Version 3.18 of the survey package is now percolating through CRAN.

Since the last announcement on this list, in February, the main additions are
  - standard errors for survival curves (both Kaplan-Meier and Cox model)
  - svyciprop() for confidence intervals on proportions, especially in small samples or near 0 or 1.
  - predictive margins by direct standardization, with marginpred()
  - two-phase subsampling designs can now have arbitrary multistage designs at each phase
  - Rao-Scott-type likelihood ratio tests are now available for glms and the Cox model
  - a wide range of options for PPS designs without replacement

There is also experimental support for parallel processing using the 'multicore' package.

Message-ID: <1254406545.18275.35.camel@punchbuggy>

After an extremely long gestation, a new version of the coxme package is
now available on CRAN.  This function fits very general mixed-effects
Cox models using an lmer-like syntax.  For instance here is a model that
fits a random treatment effect, using data from a multi-study
collaboration.

   fit <- coxme(Surv(pg.time, pg.stat) ~ stage + trt + (trt|site) +
		     stata(site), data= multicolon)

The program allows for multiple random effects, and differing variance
structures for them.  It currently has a fairly simple vignette showing
how to use the package; I'll be improving this to include more examples
over the next few months.

Dear All,

We are happy to announce the release of the new version of DEoptim 
(version 2.0-0) which is now available from CRAN.

The DEoptim package [3] performs Differential Evolution (DE) minimization, 
a genetic algorithm-based optimization technique [2,3]. This allows robust 
minimization over a continuous (bounded or not) domain.

The new DEoptim function calls a C implementation of the DE algorithm 
similar to the MS Visual C++ v5.0 implementation distributed with [2].

More details on DE optimization can be found on the DE homepage [1].

We believe that the DE approach may be applicable in many fields of 
research and hope that the package DEoptim will be fruitful for many 
researchers.

Kate Mullen and David Ardia

MODIFICATIONS
   o The R-based implementation of Differential Evolution has been
     replaced with a C-based implementation similar to the MS Visual C++
     v5.0 implementation accompanying the book `Differential Evolution -
     A Practical Approach to Global Optimization',downloaded from
     http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/DeWin.zip.

     The new C implementation is significantly faster.

   o The S3 method for plotting has been enhanced. It allows now to plot
     the intermediate populations if provided.

   o The package maintainer has been changed to Katharine Mullen,
     <katharine.mullen at nist.gov>.

   o A NAMESPACE has been added.

   o Argument FUN for DEoptim is now called fn for compatibility with
     optim.

   o demo file has been removed

   o CITATION file modified

Subject: [R-pkgs] Updates to rms package
Message-ID: <4ACC8D6C.20603@vanderbilt.edu>

The rms package, a replacement for the Design package, has been updated 
on CRAN.  The most major change is the addition of smooth calibration 
curves for externally (val.surv function) or internally (calibrate.cph, 
calibrate.psm) validating a survival model with right-censored data. 
The polspline package is used to estimate the survival probability at a 
fixed time point as a function of the predicted survival probability. 
Some user-requested plotting features have been added to bplot and 
plot.Predict.

Changes in version 2.1-0
    * Made Predict not return invisibly if predictors not specified
    * New option nlines for plot.Predict for getting line plots with 2 
categorical predictors
    * Added rename option to rbind.Predict to handle case where 
predictor name has changed between models
    * Added ties=mean to approx( ) calls that did not have ties= specified
    * Added nlevels argument to bplot to pass to contour
    * Added par argument to iLegend - list to pass to par().
    * Redirected ... argument to iLegend to image( ).
    * Fixed groupkm - was printing warning messages wrongly
    * Added new semiparametric survival prediction calibration curve 
method in val.surv for external validation; this is the first 
implementation of smooth calibration curves for survival probability 
validation with right-censored data
    * Fixed calibrate confidence limits from groupkm
    * Added smooth calibration curve using hare (polspline package) for 
calibrate.cph and calibrate.psm
    * Added display of predicted risks for cph and psm models even for 
the stratified KM method (old default)

Dear R users,

the tmvtnorm package, the package for the truncated multivariate normal distribution, has been updated on CRAN.

The major changes in version 0.8 are:
* Reimplemented the Gibbs' sampler for random number generation in Fortran for performance reasons. This compiled code is now even faster than conventional rejection sampling and allows for the generation of large amounts of random numbers even in high dimensions.
* Added a function ptmvnorm.marginal() for the one-dimensional marginal probabilities/CDF.

With the release of R-2.10.0 I have divided the dse bundle into packages. The bundled package dse1 and part of dse2 are now in the new package dse. The remaining part of dse2 is in a new package EvalEst. The package dse does multivariate ARMA and state space time series modelling and forecasting, while package EvalEst is now focused on the evaluation of estimation methods. To aid transition, there are packages dse1 and dse2 on CRAN. These do nothing except require the new packages dse and EvalEst respectively, but should help prevent breaking of existing code that requires() dse1 or dse2.

I have also taken this opportunity to do a long overdue cleanup of the Users' Guides distributed as vignettes in the packages.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New version of package ff
Message-ID: <1409290745@web.de>

Dear R community,

ff Version 2.1.1 is available on CRAN. It now supports large data.frames, 
csv import/export, packed atomic datatypes and bit filtering from package 
'bit' on which it depends from now.

Some performance results in seconds from test data with 78 mio rows and 7 columns on a 3 GB notebook:

sequential reading 1 mio rows: csv = 32.7  ffdf = 1.3
sequential writing 1 mio rows: csv = 35.5  ffdf = 1.5

Examples of things you can do with ff and bit:
- direct random access to rows of large data-frame instead of talking to SQL database (?ffdf)
- store 4-level factor like A,T,G,C with 2bit instead of 32bit (?vmode)
- fast chunked iteration (?chunk)
- run linear model on large dataset using biglm (?chunk.ffdf)
- handle boolean selections by factor 32 faster and less RAM consuming (?bit)
- handle very skewed selections very fast (?bitwhich)
- parallel access to large dataset just by sending ff's small metadata from master to slaves (e.g. with snowfall)

ff is hosted on r-forge now and you find some presentations on ff at
http://ff.r-forge.r-project.org/

Hope you find this useful. We appreciate any feedback.

Message-ID: <4AF97BDA.3020608@isped.u-bordeaux2.fr>

Dear All,

We are happy to announce, after a long gestation, the release of the new 
version of FRAILTYPACK (version 2.2-9.5) which is now available from 
CRAN. The package fit general frailty models using penalized likelihood 
estimation, for clustered or recurrent events.

For instance :

--  ADDITIVE FRAILTY MODELS for proportional hazards models with two 
correlated random effects (intercept random effect with random slope):

  
fitAdditive<-additivePenal(Surv(t1,t2,event)~cluster(group)+var1+slope(var1), 

  correlation=TRUE,data=dataAdditive,n.knots=8,kappa1=10000)


--  NESTED FRAILTY MODELS for hierarchically clustered data (with 2 
levels of clustering) by including two random effects:

  
fitnested<-frailtyPenal(Surv(t1,t2,event)~cluster(group)+subcluster(subgroup), 

  data=dataNested,n.knots=8,kappa1=50000)

-- JOINT FRAILTY MODELS in the context of joint modelling of recurrent 
events with terminal event:

  fitJoint<-frailtyPenal(Surv(time.entry,time.end,status)~cluster(id)+
    
terminal(status.terminal),formula.terminalEvent=~status.terminal,data=dataJoint 

  ,n.knots=12,kappa1=1,kappa2=1,joint=TRUE,recurrentAG=TRUE)

We included several examples.

Message-ID: <62C82B39B8A85E4B95A18F7F7B852F87055902A343@exvic-mbx03.nexus.csiro.au>

New versions of the 'mvbutils' and 'debug' packages are now available on CRAN. These should work with R 2.10 as well as R 2.9.

'mvbutils' offers tools for organization of workspaces, function/documentation editing with backups, package construction and updating, seamless per-object lazy-loading, and various miscellaneous goodies.

New in this version: nearly-automated package building using only plain-text documentation, plus the ability to edit & update your package while it's loaded, i.e. without needing to reinstall it or to quit R. These new features are "beta level"; they've been tested by me and some colleagues, but are still a bit experimental. Comments welcome.

'debug' is a debugger with: separate code windows; line-numbered conditional breakpoints; continuation on errors; direct interpretation of commands from console; skipping backwards & forwards; handling of 'on.exit'. This version fixes a few minor bugs.

Message-ID: <4B0A9F6F.1050001@stamats.de>

The new version 2.2 of our distr-family of packages has now been 
available on CRAN for several days. As there were many changes we will 
only sketch the most important ones here. For more details see the 
corresponding NEWS files (e.g. news(package = "distr") or using function 
NEWS from package startupmsg i.e. NEWS("distr")).

First of all a new package distrEllipse was added to the family which 
includes S4 classes and methods for elliptical symmetric distributions.

## All packages (distr, distrEx, distrSim, distrTEst, distrTeach,
##                         distrMod, distrEllipse, distrDoc as well as
##                         startupmsg and SweaveListingUtils)
##############################################
- TOBEDONE file was added as a starting point for collaborations. The
  file can be displayed via function TOBEDONE from package startupmsg;
  e.g. TOBEDONE("distr")
- tests/Examples folder for some automatic testing was introduced


##############################################
## Package distr
##############################################
- new diagnostic function (more specifically S4 method)
                                  qqplot()

  as argument;  in addition to function qqplot() from package "stats"
  has functionality for point-wise and simultaneous confidence bands
- under the hood: a new slot symmetry was introduced
  for distributions

##############################################
## Package distrEx
##############################################

    [see help & NEWS file]
 * integrated Andrew Ellis's nice ideas into SweaveListingUtils
    to use \lstenvironment
 * individual markup style for base or recommended packages
   (checked for with new function isBaseOrRecommended()) is
    distinct now by default (extra color RRecomdcolor)
 * temporarily changes (like background color) made easier:
    by new functions
     + lstdefRstyle to change Rstyle
     + lstsetRall to change all R-like styles (i.e. Rstyle, Rinstyle,

Subject: [R-pkgs] Deducer: An R data analysis GUI
Message-ID: <bd27195cb539a9f82317852a91e1b7d5.squirrel@mail.stat.ucla.edu>

Announcing a new version of Deducer:

Deducer 0.2-1 is an intuitive, cross-platform graphical data analysis
system. It uses menus and dialogs to guide the user efficiently through
the data manipulation and analysis process, and has an excel like
spreadsheet for easy data frame visualization and editing. Deducer works
best when used with the Java based R GUI JGR, but the dialogs can be
called from the command line. Dialogs have also been integrated into the
Windows Rgui.

The statistical methods and concepts covered by the dialogs is increasing,
and currently includes:

Data Manipulation: factor editing, Variable recoding, subseting, sorting,
merging, transposing, opening data (text and foreign), and saving data

Analysis: Frequencies, Descriptives, Contingency tables (and related
statistics), one-sample, two-sample, k-sample tests, as well as
correlations

Models: Linear Models (with optional HCCM), Logistic regression,
Generalized Linear Models

Since it?s initial release in August, there have been significant changes
to the back-end as well as the programmatic interface. This has resulted
in increased stability, and made for easier incorporation of Deducer?s R
functions into non-GUI programs. Additionally, a plug-in interface has
been added, which allows arbitrary packages to add onto Deducer?s menu
system.

Message-ID: <28152c800912041211y787668ew3cfc3b2bb4289d3e@mail.gmail.com>

At long last pgfSweave has finally made its way to CRAN.

The pgfSweave package is about speed and style of graphics. For speed,
the package provides capabilities for ?caching? graphics generated
with Sweave on top of the caching funcitonality of cacheSweave. For
style the pgfSweave package facilitates the integration of R graphics
with LaTeX reports through the tikzDevice package and eps2pgf utility.
With these tools, figure labels are converted to LaTeX strings so they
match the style of the document and the full range of LaTeX math
symbols/equations are available.

The backbone of pgfSweave is a a new driver for Sweave
(pgfSweaveDriver). The driver provides new chunk options tikz, pgf and
external on top of the cache option provided by cacheSweave.

This package started as a fork (hack) of cacheSweave to suit our own
narrow purposes and has since become a valuable tool for much of our
own work.  We hope you will find it useful as well.

Message-ID: <57e838140912090704tde0815lf9b9611b4cbbc9d6@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to announce the availability of the new "doMPI" package, a
parallel backend for the "foreach" package, which acts as an adaptor to
the "Rmpi" package.  The package has been uploaded to CRAN and is now
available.

Like the "doSNOW" package, "doMPI" allows you to execute foreach loops
in parallel using "Rmpi" as the underlying transport.  But I was
interested in experimenting with using "Rmpi" directly so that data that
was used in all iterations of a foreach loop could be broadcast to the
cluster workers using the "Rmpi" mpi.bcast function.  I also wanted to
write the package so it could fetch arguments and process results
dynamically, allowing it to handle an arbitrary number of tasks in a
memory efficient way.

The package includes a number of example scripts and an introductory
vignette, in addition to the standard help documentation.  The vignette
also attempts to explain how to run "doMPI" scripts using the Open MPI
"orterun" command, which I hope helps people who are new to "Rmpi" get
started running parallel R programs.

Message-ID: <b7bfe54e0912091613l2b16a713mc6798f5ab9c0b5c8@mail.gmail.com>

Hey R people,

I have just put a package on CRAN, mecdf 0.2.1.

It computes multivariate ECDFs.
i.e. Estimates (or perhaps I should say evaluates) a multivariate
cumulative distribution function, using data, without any assumptions
per se.
Plus contrary to my own advise, the vignette contains some pretty
pictures of the bivariate normal...

The current package is relatively simple.
However, I have searched for this topic, and found very little
information, so I regard this as a new(ish) topic.

The package is still new and relatively untested.
I'm planning to implement smooth(ish) distribution functions in the
near future. e.g. Interpolating the step function (possibly with some
other adjustments).
Suggestions (including criticisms) welcome, especially while the package is new.


Merry Christmas, group hug...

Message-ID: <f8e6ff050912102003w5eb363bbm9f67d60b376516d9@mail.gmail.com>

ggplot2 ------------------------------------------------------------

ggplot2 is a plotting system for R, based on the grammar of graphics,
which tries to take the good parts of base and lattice graphics and
avoid bad parts. It takes care of many of the fiddly details
that make plotting a hassle (like drawing legends) as well as
providing a powerful model of graphics that makes it easy to produce
complex multi-layered graphics.

To install or update, run:
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "plyr"))

Find out more at http://had.co.nz/ggplot2, and check out the nearly 500
examples of ggplot in use.  If you're interested, you can also sign up to
the ggplot2 mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/ggplot2, or track
development at  http://github.com/hadley/ggplot2

ggplot2 0.8.4 (2009-12-08) ----------------------------------------

* aes and aes_string both convert prefixes to full names
* aesthetics: corrected list of aesthetics to include american spelling of
  colour as well as base R abbreviations
* aesthetics: fix bug in detecting which aesthetics are calculated
* aes_string treats NULL as "NULL"
* annotate now works with missing x and y (e.g. for geom_rect)
* continuous scale limits now automatically sorted
* coord_polar: fix bug if breaks not all inside limits
* facet_wrap: can now specify both ncol and nrow without getting an error
* facet_wrap: now works with statistics that produce both x and y values (e.g.
  stat_qq)
* fullseq now adds additional break on bottom if necessary, so that the
  include.lowest argument in cut never comes into play (this the source of a
  potential bug in histograms)
* geom_boxplot: alpha now affects fill colour of boxes only
* geom_path correctly switches to segments if varying alpha used (thanks to
  Karl Ove Hufthammer for the report and Baptiste Auguie for the fix)
* geom_point: the alpha aesthetic now also affects the fill.
* geom_ribbon always sorts input to avoid problems with certain pathological
  inputs
* geom_smooth was incorrectly applying alpha to line colour in the legend
* nullGrob renamed to zeroGrob to avoid name conflict with grid
* position_collide now works with missing values
* position_stack: fixed bug in detection of overlap for negative values
* scale_discrete_position now uses drop argument to force dropping of unused
  levels
* scale_gradient, scale_gradient2 and scale_gradientn now uses label
  parameters, if supplied
* scale_x_inverse, scale_y_inverse now actually work, and added recip as alias
* stat_qq now correctly groups results
* stat_smooth will not try and fit a line to 2 or fewer points (previously
  didn't try for only 1 point)
* stat_spoke now works with reversed scales
* grouping: now consistent between different geoms (Issue #33)

Subject: [R-pkgs] Rcpp 0.7.0: R/C++ integration now even easier
Message-ID: <19248.13681.21625.678963@ron.nulle.part>


Rcpp version 0.7.0 went onto CRAN this weekend. The key new features are

  o inline support, taken from Oleg Sklyar's neat inline package and 
    adapted/extented to support Rcpp as well as external libraries
    (see below for an example); this even works on Windows (provided you 
    have Rtools installed and configured); 

  o addition of a new simple type RcppSexp for importing or exporting
    simple types directly between R and C++

  o addition of a number of new examples for both these features

  o code reorganisation: every class has in its own header and source file 

  o last but not least relicensed from LGPL (>=2.1) to GPL (>= 2)

My blog (http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/) has two recent posts with a bit
more details (and colour highlighting of the code below) but let's just look
at one example of using GNU GSL functions for illustrative purposes (as you
wouldn't need this to access random-number generators as R has its own).

Consider this R code snippet:

    ## use Rcpp to pass down a parameter for the seed, and a vector size
    gslrng <- '
       int seed = RcppSexp(s).asInt();
       int len = RcppSexp(n).asInt();

       gsl_rng *r;
       gsl_rng_env_setup();
       std::vector<double> v(len);

       r = gsl_rng_alloc (gsl_rng_default);

       gsl_rng_set (r, (unsigned long) seed);
       for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {
           v[i] = gsl_rng_get (r);
       }
       gsl_rng_free(r);

       return RcppSexp(v).asSexp();
       '

    ## turn into a function that R can call
    ## compileargs redundant on Debian/Ubuntu as gsl headers are found anyway
    funx <- cfunction(signature(s="numeric", n="numeric"),
                      gslrng,
                      includes="#include <gsl/gsl_rng.h>",
                      Rcpp=TRUE,
                      cppargs="-I/usr/include",
                      libargs="-lgsl -lgslcblas")
    print(funx(0, 5))


Brief notes on this:

  1)  The character variable gslrng contains valid C++ code.

  2)  The call to cfunction converts this C++ code into a function that
      calls it -- and this function is compiled, linked and loaded
      automagically simply using hints about GSL header files and libraries.

  3)  The interface is explit: cfunction() is told about a function signature
      with numeric variables 's' and 'n'; this is what the C++ code convert
      to (C++ local) variables 'seed' and 'len' using the RcppSexp class.

  4)  We return a single SEXP to R which is based on the std::vector<double>
      v which is also converted on the fly.

  5)  The resulting vector is returned and simply printed at the R level.


More examples are in the source tarball and in the R-Forge SVN archive.

Cheers, Dirk

See NEWS for changes in latest version

ggplot2 0.8.5 (2009-12-15) ----------------------------------------

New features

* geom_text gains parse argument which makes it possible to display
  expressions. (Implements #50)

* all scales now have legend parameter, which defaults to TRUE. Setting to
  false will prevent that scale from contributing to the legend (Implements
  #27)

* default axis labels and legend titles are now stored in the options, instead
  of in each scale. This fixes a long standing bug where it was not easy to
  set the label for computed variable, such as the y axis on a histogram.
  Additionally, it means default scales are only added to the plot until just
  prior to plotting, instead of the previous behaviour where scales where
  added as layers were added - this could cause problems if you later modified
  the underlying data. (Implements #28)

* coord_equal: when ratio = NULL (the default), it will adjust the aspect
  ratio of the plot, rather than trying to extend the shortest axis.

* x and y positions can be set to Inf or -Inf to refer to the top/right and
  bottom/left extents of the panel. (Implements #18)

* expand_limits(): a new function to make it easy to force the inclusion of
  any set of values in the limits of any aesthetic.

New features (minor)

* aesthetics: when _setting_ an aesthetic, you may only set it to a single
  value.  This was always a good idea, but now it is enforced with an
  informative error message.
* stat_contour bump up default number of contours
* stat_density2d: make number of grid points used for density estimation
  user controllable (implements #9)
* geom_bin now allows you to set whether bins used intervals of the form
  (a, b] or [a, b) with the "right" parameter (implements #20)
* geom_path: linejoin, lineend and linemitre are now user controllable
  (implements #24)
* scales: all scales check that breaks are supplied if labels are, and
  that breaks and labels are the same length (implements #40)
* scales: if breaks are a named vector, the names will be used as labels
  (thanks to suggestion by David Kahle)
* scale_colour_gradient, scale_colour_gradient2 & scale_colour_gradientn now
  have formatter argument to match scale_continuous
* updated citation to refer to the ggplot2 book

Bug fixes

* coord_cartesian now correctly sets limits when one or both of the position
  scales are non-linear.  (fixes #17)
* coord_equal: now works with non-linear scales (fixes #13)
* coord_map sets aspect ratio correctly (fixes #4)
* coord_polar correctly combines labels on end of axis if expressions
  (fixes #39)
* coord_trans now respects scale expand parameter (expansion occurs after
  transformation) (fixes #14)
* facet_grid with scales = "free" and space = "free" now calculates space
  correctly if the range of the scale is < 1 (fixes #1)
* facet_grid works once more when facetting with multiple variables in one
  direction (fixes #11)
* facet_wrap now sets aspect ratio correctly
* facet_wrap now maintains original order of data
* geom_hline and geom_vline now work with coord_flip (fixes #30)
* geom_path drops missing values at start and end of each line (fixes #41)
* scale_shape_discrete, scale_size_continuous, scale_alpha and
  scale_linetype_discrete added to scales to match naming convention of all
  other scales (fixes #47)
* legends now correctly calculate label widths (fixes #38)
* legends will only merge if both the title and all labels are the same.
  (fixes #16)
* legends: fix for bug #19: Legend with three constraints doesn't work
* stat_contour & stat_density2d: fix grouping bugs (issue #7)
* xlim, ylim: fix bug when setting limits of discrete scales

CHANGES TO RELEASE ?3.6.0

RELEASE 3.6.0 represents the last and final major upgrade
of this product. ?Current and future functionality will migrate to the
new CRAN package, Random Forests for Survival, Regression, and
Classification, that will be released in the coming months.

Key changes to the current release are as follows:

o The ability to fully analyze competing risk data including ensemble
?estimation, error rates, and VIMP by event type. ?Can also predict
?on test data. ?Missing data imputation is also available. See rsf()
?and competing.risk() for details.

o Automatic variable selection using minimal depth theory implemented
?in the new function varSel(). ?Also see the core function
?max.subtree().

o Pairwise interactions between variables using minimal depth theory.
?See find.interaction() for more details.

o The ability to analyze mean minimal depth information by individual
?(for variable selection at the individual level). See the
?documentation for rsf() for more information.

o Impute only mode for extremely fast imputation of data. ?See the
?documentation for impute.rsf() fro more details.

o The ability to export forests to a Java (JUNG) based plug-in. ?This
?allows one to visualize individual trees in the forest. See the
?documentation for rsf2rfz() for more information.

o Modification to random splitting to grow deeper trees.

o Fix of memory leak in INTERACTION mode. ?Thanks to Xi Chen for
?finding this feature. ?Other miscellaneous bug fixes.

DCE-MRI and DWI, with specific emphasis on cancer imaging
applications.? Additional major features include:

? o  S4 classes for NIfTI and Analyze data formats that merges header
and data information
  o  Simplified import/export functions with NIfTI header extension support
  o  Complete "audit trail" functionality, in XML, stored as a NIfTI
header extension
  o  Graphical methods for "lightbox", "orthographic" and "overlay" displays
  o  Expanded vignette with examples

I look forward to receiving feedback on this project.

cheers...

Subject: [R-pkgs] sqldf 0.2-0
Message-ID: <971536df0912251125x3713decdu1003cca9b689888e@mail.gmail.com>

A new version of sqldf, version 0.2-0, has been uploaded to CRAN and
should be available on most mirrors by now.

NEW

- works with the new version of DBI package, DBI 0.2-5.   The default
action of this version of DBI quotes those column names in select
statements that are SQL reserved words (rather than appending __1 to
them which was the previous default action).  As a result it should no
longer be necessary to refer to Time as Time__1, etc. Thus this now
works where BOD is a 6 row data frame that comes with R and has the
indicated column names:

     sqldf("select Time, demand from BOD")

- if the libspatialite-1.dll sqlite loadable extension is found on
PATH then it will automatically be loaded into SQLite the first time
sqldf is called in a session.  This gives access to several dozen new
SQL functions.  For a complete list see:

     http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/spatialite-sql-2.3.1.html

  For example, stddev_pop and var_pop are functions provided in the
dll used in this example:

     sqldf("select avg(demand) mean, stddev_pop(demand) sd,
var_pop(demand) var from BOD")

  (If the loadable extension is not found then sqldf still works with
all the functionality it previously had but the new functions in the
loadable extension will, of course, not be available.  Note that this
loadable extension does not come with sqldf ; however, it is free
software distributed under the Mozilla public license and the user may
download it from http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/binaries.html  and
place the dll on their PATH to get automatic access from sqldf).

- new filter argument on read.csv.sql

- read.csv2.sql added.  This is like read.csv.sql but uses a default
filter which translates all commas to dots.  On Windows it pipes the
input file through a custom vbscript that comes with sqldf and on
other systems it uses tr , .   (In both cases the result is the same.)
 read.csv2.sql is used to read data files originating in certain
European countries.

OVERVIEW

sqldf is an R package that allows one to manipulate R data frames and
input files using SQL from within R.  It is layered on top of RSQLite,
DBI and the sqlite database.  Typical usage involves a single line of
R code calling sqldf and containing a string argument which is the
select statement.  sqldf automatically sets up a database and table
definitions, runs the select statement, retrieves the result and
destroys the database.  For more information including many examples
of use see the home page at:

   http://sqldf.googlecode.com

and the help files in the package.

Subject: [R-pkgs] micEcon split into miscTools, micEconAids, and micEcon
Message-ID: <ee2a35a60912280224p44cb8f1dy186a29448f68bca7@mail.gmail.com>

The "micEcon" package has been split into three packages: miscTools,
micEconAids, and micEcon.

a) miscTools (version 0.6-0) includes miscellaneous small tools and
utilities that are not related to (micro)economics, e.g. colMedians(),
rowMedians(), insertCol(), insertRow(), vecli(), symMatrix(),
triang(), semidefiniteness(), compPlot(), and rSquared(). The
miscTools package should depend on (almost) no other packages so that
it can be used in other packages without increasing the total
(recursive!) dependencies of these packages too much.

b) micEconAids (version 0.6-0) includes all functions and methods for
demand analysis with the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) of Deaton
and Muellbauer (1980). Since these functions and methods comprised a
large and rather specific "group" within the "old" micEcon package, it
makes sense (IMHO) to separate them into a separate package.

c) micEcon (version 0.6-0) includes the remaining parts of the "old"
micEcon package, e.g. for economic analysis with Cobb-Douglas
functions, translog functions, quadratic functions, CES (constant
elasticity of substitution) functions, SNQ (symmetric normalized
quadratic = generalized McFadden) profit functions, or linearly
homogeneous non-parametric functions.

I have uploaded all three packages to CRAN. They should be available
for download on CRAN and its mirrors (at latest) in a few days.

Feedback is highly welcome!
