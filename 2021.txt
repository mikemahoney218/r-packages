Subject: [R-pkgs] weibulltools version 2.0.0 released on CRAN
Message-ID: <5ccc8b828aba487bb2fe02293acf27a3@tu-berlin.de>

Dear all, 

we are happy to announce that a new version of weibulltools is available on CRAN. 
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=weibulltools  

weibulltools is a package that focuses on statistical methods and visualizations that are often used in reliability engineering. 
The core idea is to provide a compact and easily accessible set of methods and visualization tools that make the examination and 
adjustment as well as the analysis and interpretation of field and bench test data as simple as possible. 

Compared to previous releases (<= 1.0.1), the new version (2.0.0) includes a data-based interface through which the obtained function outputs 
can be easily passed into subsequent methods and visualizations. 
Furthermore, all visualizations that were generated dynamically with 'plotly', can now also be created statically with the support of 'ggplot2'. 

The previously used vector-based approach has been largely preserved but is no longer recommended.

Examples for the usage of the new interface, the documentation of all functions, as well as further changes can be found at 
https://tim-tu.github.io/weibulltools/

If you notice a bug or have suggestions for improvements, please submit an issue with a minimal reproducible example at 
https://github.com/Tim-TU/weibulltools/issues/

Best regards, 
Tim-Gunnar Hensel and David Barkemeyer

Message-ID: <4D51D79E-F197-4D31-A4B7-6396F1B2DD00@illinois.edu>

Hi All,

I hope this message finds you well.

We have released simplePHENOTYPES v1.3.0.  Our package simulates single and multiple (correlated) traits in a wide range of scenarios, including additive, dominance, and epistatic (AxA, AxAxA, ...) models.

Some of the new features include:
- The option to specify what markers will be used as QTNs
- Implemented the parameter "ld_max" and ?ld_min? for simulating spurious pleiotropy
- Implemented the option for simulating more than two-way epistatic interactions
- Included the parameter 'mean', so traits can be simulated with the desired mean (intercept) value.

Please check it our here:
https://cran.r-project.org/package=simplePHENOTYPES
Vignettes for the most common scenarios one would want to simulate may be found here:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simplePHENOTYPES/vignettes/simplePHENOTYPES.html

Message-ID: <14DF4068-DD33-406D-A06D-3A56E37911A1@pm.me>

sensobol: an R package to compute variance-based sensitivity indices

Sensobol 1.0.0 is already in CRAN, and a detailed vignette can be found in CRAN and in arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10103

It allows to rapidly compute, bootstrap and plot up to third-order Sobol'-based sensitivity indices using several state-of-the-art first and total-order estimators. Sobol' indices can be computed either for models that yield a scalar as a model output or for systems of differential equations. The package also provides a suit of benchmark tests functions and several options to obtain publication-ready figures of the model output uncertainty and sensitivity-related analysis.

Message-ID: <9491E023-38EC-461C-95E8-81704FD9441F@gmail.com>

The newest release of the ethnobotanyR package (v0.1.8) calculates common quantitative ethnobotany indices to assess the cultural significance of plant species based on informant consensus. The package closely follows two papers, one on cultural importance indices (Tardio and Pardo-de-Santayana 2008) and another on agrobiodiversity valuation (Whitney, Bahati, and Gebauer 2018). The newest version of ethnobotanyR (0.1.8) has been released with a number of new features:

The goal is to provide an easy-to-use platform for ethnobotanists to work with quantitative ethnobotany assessments. 

Install the released version of ethnobotanyR from CRAN with 
install.packages("ethnobotanyR")

Install the working version of ethnobotanyR from GitHub with 
devtools::install_github("CWWhitney/ethnobotanyR")

Hello All,

  I am pleased to announce that {domir} is now available on CRAN.

  {domir} aims to provide broadly applicable tools for the relative 
importance analysis of facets of statistical models and machine 
learning algorithms.  The focus for this initial release is on 
Dominance Analysis/Shapley Value Decomposition as a methodology - which 
is to be expanded in future versions.

  I hope the community finds the tool(s) in this package of value and I 
look forward to further developing the package in collaboration with 
the community.

  Note: {domir} version 0.0.0 has a known bug that affects 
functionality in R versions < 4.  Working on a patch to revise.

  Cordially,

- Joseph

Hello everyone,

Very happy to announce my first release on CRAN: *meedr. *The goal is to
provide quick and easy access to market expectations data to the main
macroeconomic indicators in the Focus report, made available by the Central
Bank of Brazil through the Expectations System data API. This data comes
from several financial institutions, such as: banks, brokers, funds,
consultancies, etc.

The *meedr* package offers an R interface to the API and other advantages:

   - Use of a caching system with package memoise to speed up repeated
   requests of data;
   - User can utilize all cores of the machine (parallel computing) when
   fetching a large batch of time series.


You can install the released version of meedr from CRAN with:
*install.packages("meedr")*

Message-ID: <6049a9ec-bd7f-790a-fb64-be90f08f1c76@sissa.it>

Dear all,

I would like to share with you my package {fcci}, which has just been 
accepted by CRAN <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fcci>.

This tiny package provides support for building Feldman-Cousins 
<https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.57.3873> 
confidence intervals (for Poisson rate and binomial proportions, by now).

The Feldman-Cousins prescription was originally developed in the context 
of High-Energy Physics, as a consistent method for providing classical 
(frequentist) confidence intervals for rates of rare events. It is, in 
general, useful when dealing with experiments which expect very few 
events, and works well with rate estimation in the presence of 
significant (spurious) background.

If you have any feedback, suggestion or bug to communicate, you can 
reach out to me through the GitHub repository or by email 
(vgherard at sissa.it).

Dear R users,

 

I am happy to announce that gmgm 1.0.2 is available on CRAN:

https://cran.r-project.org/package=gmgm

 

gmgm provides a complete framework to create, manipulate, learn the
structure and the parameters, and perform inference in Gaussian mixture
graphical models, which include Bayesian networks and dynamic Bayesian
networks (their temporal extension) whose local probability distributions
are described by Gaussian mixture models.

 

The related GitHub project and an example of use of this package can be
found at:

https://github.com/jeremyroos/gmgm

 

Please feel free to contact me for more details or to report any issue.

Subject: [R-pkgs] superb (version 0.9.5.0) released to CRAN
Message-ID: <YQXPR0101MB08238462CC29689B25D6BE269C449@YQXPR0101MB0823.CANPRD01.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear all, 

we are happy to announce that the package ``superb`` is now available on CRAN. 
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=superb  

``superb`` (Summary statistics Plots with adjusted Error Bars) is a package that produces
plots of summary statistics with adjusted error bars. These bars are adjusted to
allow pairwise comparisons in both between and within-subject design (Baguley, 2012; https://doi.org/10.3758%2Fs13428-011-0123-7). 

The latest version 0.9.5.0 (Codename "95% confident") is a spin-off of the package 
``MeanPlot`` for Mathematica 10.0 and above (Cousineau, 2017; https://doi.org/10.5709/acp-0214-z).

With simple adjustments, you get raw confidence intervals or standard errors, but also
intervals adjusted for within-subject-designs and more.

The plots created are ggplot objects that can be fully customized for your purpose. The package generates advanced plots such as raincloud plots and violin plots, for example:
 

Examples for the usage of the main function ``superbPlot()``, the documentation of all functions, as well as vignettes can be found at 
https://dcousin3.github.io/superb/

If you notice a bug or have suggestions for improvements, please submit an issue with a minimal reproducible example at 
https://github.com/dcousin3/superb/issues/

A complete text describing the ``superb`` framework and philosophy is currently under 
considerations as Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Sciences.

Best, 
Denis Cousineau

Dear R community,

A new version of diveMove (1.6.0) is now on CRAN
(https://cran.r-project.org/package=diveMove).  diveMove offers tools
and utilities for performing essential tasks for the analysis of
time-depth recoder (TDR) data loggers.

The latest version completes the framework for modelling mixtures of
exponential distributions, a common approach for identifying transitions
between events such as dives occurring in bouts.  A new class is now
available to represent such data, with methods and functions available
for:

* Fitting models via non-linear least squares and maximum likelihood
  (recommended).
* Determining bout-ending criteria.
* Plotting predicted and observed data, including cumulative frequency
  distribution.
* Generating samples from mixtures of distributions.

The new class and associated methods make a number of functions in
previous versions obsolete.  Please see help(diveMove-defunct) and
help(diveMove-deprecated) for details.

Hi All,

Version 1.0.0 of the new BI package is now on CRAN.

The BI package will generate the James Blinding Index, as described in 
James et al (1996, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8841652/) and the 
Bang Blinding Index, as described in Bang et al (2004, 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15020033/).

These are measures to assess whether or not satisfactory blinding has 
been maintained in a randomized, controlled, clinical trial. These can 
be generated for trial subjects, research coordinators and principal 
investigators, based upon standardized questionnaires that have been 
administered, to assess whether or not they can correctly guess to which 
treatment arm (e.g. placebo or treatment) subjects were assigned at 
randomization.


The package is available from:

   https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BI

and is maintained on Github:

Subject: [R-pkgs] Announcing RweaveExtra
Message-ID: <2A51428D-5C81-467A-80A1-640AA37A440A@me.com>

Hi all,

A new package is now available on CRAN: RweaveExtra 1.0-0, which provides "Sweave Drivers with Extra Tricks Up their Sleeve".

Call me an old timer, but I always stuck to Sweave ever since it introduced me to literate programming. I just prefer the simplicity of the system. 

Now, I developed a workflow over the last few of years where one option was missing in the weave and tangle 	steps: the ability to completely ignore a code chunk. Sure, one can use 'eval = FALSE', but this is not equivalent. First, the code in the chunk is parsed. Second, the code is commented out in the tangled file. 

What if I want to write unparsable code (say for didactic purposes) or code in a foreign language altogether, and that I want this code to appear as is in the tangled script? This is where RweaveExtra comes in. Use the 'RweaveExtraLatex' driver with the chunk option 'ignore.on.weave=TRUE' and the code in the chunk will be completely ignored (not even parsed) on the weave step, but it will still be written out verbatim (uncommented) in the tangle step. (For symmetry reasons, an 'ignore.on.tangle' option also exists for the 'RtangleExtra' driver, but I never had use for it.)

See ?RweaveExtraLatex for a complete example.

I have been using the package "privately" for the past year without any issue.

I hope that the new drivers may prove useful to the community.

Dear R users,

I am happy to announce that my package monobin is now available on CRAN.

The package contains functions that perform monotonic binning of numeric
risk factor in credit rating models (PD, LGD, EAD) development. All
functions handle both binary and continuous target variable. Functions that
use isotonic regression in the first stage of binning process have an
additional feature for correction of minimum percentage of observations and
minimum target rate per bin. Additionally, monotonic trend can be
identified based on raw data or, if known in advance, forced by functions'
argument. Missing values and other possible special values are treated
separately from so-called complete cases.
Close attention should be paid when modeling continuous target due to
possible negative values.

Hope that some of you will find the package useful.

Best regards,
Andrija Djurovic

Dear all,



this is to announce that a new version of cryptowatchR is now available on
CRAN. It may be useful for everyone who is interested in working with data
on cryptocurrencies and crypto exchanges.



This package is a wrapper of the cryptowatch API (for a detailed
documentation see https://docs.cryptowat.ch/rest-api) and allows an easy and
free access to prices and other market data (volume, trades, order books,
bid and ask prices, live quotes, and more) of cryptocurrencies and crypto
exchanges. For example, you can easily retrieve historical prices for a
large number of cryptocurrencies without setting up an account.



The new version includes the option to use your own personal API key. This
may be relevant for heavy users of the API. Moreover, several new functions
allow access to all available data that can be retrieved from Cryptowatch.



CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cryptowatchR/index.html

GitHub: https://github.com/lorenzbr/cryptowatchR



I hope you find this package useful. Please let me know if you have any
suggestions or if you have come across any issues.



Best regards,

Message-ID: <CAJ=0CtAWkSCKJuW7poMhh1Hbn_ikb0z-810JCuSyb4RUMqKy7Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

A new package called 'declared' has made it to CRAN (platform specific
binaries in due course). This might be useful for social scientists, where
multiple (types of) missing values are declared for any given variable.

The package has a similar functionality to packages 'haven' and 'labelled',
with one but important difference: instead of treating existing values as
NAs, package declared interprets NAs as existing values (details in the
embedded vignette). Users do not have to do anything else in the subsequent
analyses, since the declared values are stored as regular NAs.

My most sincere thanks to all contributors from the r-devel list who
expressed their points regarding the treatment of missing values in R, and
especially to Duncan Murdoch who provided the starting solution.

Special thanks to Avi Gross for the subsequent email exchanges, revision of
the package and its vignette.

Hope this will prove useful, I would be grateful for feedback and bug
reports.

Message-ID: <710094407.167898.1629478164878.JavaMail.open-xchange@torgui05>

"replacer v.1.0.0"

new package submission

"replacer" is a value replacement utility currently based on the powerful
package "data.table", available on CRAN.

This utility is purposed for outside-database update of datasets. It is
accessible to beginners to `R` and facilitates complex dataset updates with
minimal prompt time by employing User-friendly functions that automatically
follow a decision tree rooted in User's input. 

The package source can be downloaded from
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=replacer
<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=replacer>

or, by typing:

install.packages('replacer')

at the R prompt. Once installed, the User can run a short example by copying the
next 3 lines below:

require(replacer)

dir = system.file('extdata', package = 'replacer')

replaceVals(dir, save = FALSE)

Familiarity with basic R commands is necessary. Familiarity with `data.table` is
not, yet strongly recommended!

Users are encouraged to start by reading the vignette found at the link above.

Thank you,

Dragos Bandur, author

Dear all,

This short email to inform you that a new version  of *superb* (SUmmary Plots with adjusted ERror Bars) is now available on CRAN (version 0.9.7.5; codename "two-tail 95% confident").

This package lets you generate plots with correct error bars without heavy programming. I know that this does not concern you, users of this mailing list, but you certainly know people around you for which plotting error bars and adjusting these to the experimental design is a challenge. Please share this announcement.

The package now comes with a shiny interface, launched from within R with the command superbShiny().

It is also available online for those who don't have R, from https://dcousin3.shinyapps.io/superbshiny/

Finally, a brief tutorial on YouTube can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw_6ll5nVus

Plotting error bars has never been so easy!

You can read more from this recently published article to *Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science* (doi: https://doi.org/10.1177/25152459211035109).

Subject: [R-pkgs] monobinShiny: Shiny User Interface for 'monobin' Package
Message-ID: <CABcwgRRpdX-Mv+Vm4dpYUcvRNX0qvO4Fr0keJkbG4nMTgWuCPg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

I am happy to announce that my new package monobinShiny is now available on
CRAN.
This is an add-on package to the 'monobin' package that simplifies its use.
As reminder, the goal of 'monobin' is to perform monotonic binning of
numeric risk factor in credit rating models (PD, LGD, EAD) development. All
functions handle both binary and continuous target variable. Missing values
and other possible special values are treated separately from so-called
complete cases.

'monobinShiny' provides shiny-based user interface to 'monobin' package and
it can be especially handy for less experienced R users as well as for
those who intend to perform quick scanning of numeric risk factors when
building credit rating models. The additional functions implemented in
'monobinShiny' that do no exist in 'monobin' package are: descriptive
statistics, special case and outliers imputation. The function descriptive
statistics is exported and can be used in R sessions independently from the
user interface, while the special case and the outlier imputation functions
are written to be used with shiny UI.

Here is, also, the link to github page:
https://github.com/andrija-djurovic/monobinShiny

Hope that some of you will find the package useful.

Best regards,
Andrija Djurovic

Message-ID: <CAJqRp3b3Hv+xxP77MRxqBaNrqkxpHPRt0=FGyi8z7GJkd9GWFg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
We have just released the R package 'fedmatch' to CRAN. Following is a
brief description and some links for more information:
With an ever-expanding set of financial data providers, each covering many
of the same firms and entities, matching data sets that do not share common
identifiers has never been more important. *fedmatch* is a set of tools for
performing record linkage between two data sets. It allows for a variety of
different matching techniques, letting the user build a matching algorithm
for their specific application. Although *fedmatch* was designed with
economic data in mind (i.e. loans or companies), it is very flexible, so it
can be used for any matching problem. With *fedmatch*, a researcher or
analyst can quickly go from having 0 matches between two datasets to having
many. With more time and care, they can use more advanced techniques to
pull out even more matches.

CRAN <https://cran.r-project.org/package=fedmatch>
Thanks,
Chris Webster

Subject: [R-pkgs] rpanel package update
Message-ID: <230AB4F1-4D98-4F1B-9E1D-7215A4267693@glasgow.ac.uk>


The rpanel package provides a set of tools to build simple GUI controls for R functions, using the tcltk R package and the Tcl/Tk system. Some ?cartoons? which use interaction and animation to communicate statistical concepts are also included.  There have been some difficulties in installing rpanel on some systems (notably Mac computers) due to the reference to a Tcl/Tk module known as BWidget.  This has now been resolved.  If BWidget is not available the rpanel package can still be installed but two facilities, namely the ?combobox? (R function rp.combo) and ?notebook? (R functions rp.notebook and rp.notebook.raise) are disabled.

Message-ID: <CAKN1paY=J_vzhwvAc-rAbv3q4-wJFuOTdUJv-jfs5w3BqBZrZw@mail.gmail.com>

The R package lmForc (lmForc 0.0.1) is now available on CRAN. lmForc
introduces functions for evaluating linear forecasting models and a new
class for working with forecast data: Forecast. Test linear models
out-of-sample by conditioning on realized values, vintage forecasts, or
lagged values. Create and test performance weighted forecasts
out-of-sample. Collect multiple forecasts and evaluate MSE or RMSE. These
functions are built around the Forecast class which matches the simplicity
and interpretability of linear models.

For additional information and examples, please visit the lmForc GitHub
repository or check out the lmForc vignette.

Message-ID: <87o87jd6mh.fsf@enricoschumann.net>

Dear all,

version 2.5-0 of package NMOF is on CRAN now.
(Incidentally, today is 20 October 2021, which marks the
10th anniversary of NMOF on CRAN.)

NMOF stands for 'Numerical Methods and Optimization in
Finance', and it accompanies the book with the same name,
written by Manfred Gilli, Dietmar Maringer and Enrico
Schumann.[1]

Since the last announcement on this list, functionality has
been added to the package, e.g. for computing minimum-CVaR
and tracking portfolios, or downloading IPO data.  See the
NEWS file [2] for all changes.  The documentation has also
been expanded.

Comments/corrections/remarks/suggestions are -- as always --
very welcome; please send them to the maintainer (me)
directly.

Kind regards
      Enrico

Message-ID: <CABcwgRSCrqq4u=UWYuja=XzOdqBBTUZXmjPFOQ8GKYxHsoazCA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

the new version of monobin package is now on CRAN.
Additional binning algorithm is implemented - monotonic binning driven by
decision tree (mdt.bin).

For details and examples, install the new version of the monobin
(install.packages("monobin")) and check the help page of the function
(?mdt.bin) or visit the github page:
https://github.com/andrija-djurovic/monobin

Soon I will upload to the CRAN updated version of monobinShiny package in
order to reflect changes from the monobin. Until then users can install
github version (https://github.com/andrija-djurovic/monobinShiny) where new
binning algorithm is already implemented.

BR,
Andrija Djurovic

Subject: [R-pkgs] qqconf: An R Package for Q-Q Plot Testing Bounds
Message-ID: <CAO=DOObcTgiq9Gz89y_g6P8A9GPcELDCo6S8K+cJrEp831Cxag@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I've recently released version 1.1.1 of qqconf
<https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/qqconf/index.html>. I'm
publicizing it for the first time as our vignette
<https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/qqconf/vignettes/qqconf_introduction.html>
tutorial
is now available. We have also published the code on github
<https://github.com/eweine/qqconf> and additional methodological details
are available on the arXiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15082>.

Our package contains a number of useful functionalities for creating
Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plots. Most importantly, qqconf can very quickly
create simultaneous testing bands for datasets of any size to conduct an
alpha level test to determine if the sample comes from a given reference
distribution. This process is much faster than any other currently
available packages, especially for large datasets.

Please reach out with any questions!

Eric.
