 Development
Message-ID: <CABcwgRRDj=V=CUp5gg=vHawRzGLXKy_uLFQMWxcyM0TsHZzhPg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

I am happy to announce that my new package PDtoolkit is now available on
CRAN.

The goal of this package is to cover the most common steps in probability
of default (PD) rating model development and validation. The main
procedures available are those that refer to univariate, bivariate,
multivariate analysis, calibration and validation. Along with accompanied
monobin and monobinShiny packages, PDtoolkit provides functions which are
suitable for different data transformation and modeling tasks such as:
imputations, monotonic binning of numeric risk factors, binning of
categorical risk factors, weights of evidence (WoE) and information value
(IV) calculations, WoE coding (replacement of risk factors modalities with
WoE values), risk factor clustering, area under curve (AUC) calculation and
others. Additionally, package provides set of validation functions for
testing homogeneity, heterogeneity, discriminatory and predictive power of
the model.

For details and examples please check out the github page
https://github.com/andrija-djurovic/PDtoolkit  or README file on CRAN page
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PDtoolkit

Best regards,
Andrija Djurovic

functions modelled on the standard graphics package using the the package
"Ternary", whose v2.0 release is now available from CRAN:
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Ternary .
The vignette at https://ms609.github.io/Ternary/articles/Holdridge.html gives
an example and pointers to detailed documentation.

Ternary 2.0 also includes a complete 'shiny' graphical user interface to
allow interactive construction of ternary plots without detailed knowledge
of R.

 phylogenetic trees
Message-ID: <CANotEPuHoVPYJ9W35rQniFmB035fD5Mf-axwUMFv-_T-V-jOYA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

Package "Rogue" has been published on CRAN:
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rogue.

"Rogue" improves phylogenetic analysis by detecting wildcard taxa whose
inconsistent position reduces split support and resolution in consensus
trees.  It implements an effective new information-theoretic approach
(Smith 2022, https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syab099), and provides an R
interface to the established "RogueNaRok" C library (Aberer et al. 2013,
https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/sys078).

A vignette demonstrating use on Bayesian posterior tree sets can be found
at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rogue/vignettes/Bayesian.html.
Questions and bug reports are welcome at https://github.com/ms609/Rogue.

Regards,

Martin Smith

Subject: [R-pkgs] Analysis of phylogenetic datasets in R: package
 "TreeSearch"
Message-ID: <CANotEPvuOsnHr1qihG5KAJ-BPjYRLC+2OA2e06xY=hCSzZyujA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

TreeSearch is an R package for phylogenetic analysis, optimized for
morphological datasets. Tree search may be conducted using under equal or
implied step weights with an explicit (albeit inexact) allowance for
inapplicable character entries, avoiding some of the pitfalls inherent in
standard parsimony methods. Profile parsimony and user-specified optimality
criteria are supported.

A graphical interface, which requires no familiarity with R, is designed to
help a user to improve the quality of datasets through critical review of
underpinning character codings; and to obtain additional information from
results by identifying and summarising clusters of similar trees, mapping
the distribution of trees, and removing ?rogue? taxa that obscure
underlying relationships.

Taken together, the package aims to support methodological rigour at each
step of data collection, analysis, and the exploration of phylogenetic
results.

A stable release of TreeSearch is now on CRAN:
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TreeSearch

An introduction to the package is provided in the vignette:
https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/articles/tree-search.html

Further details are in the BioR?iv preprint:
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.08.467735

Regards,

Martin

Message-ID: <CAPcHnpR7sUAxvQ6D-K4vmdkay8gC91Z4EcAhU3Efbz3isyP7pA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,


R package 'this.path' has received an update, the current version
number is 0.5.0
You can find this package at:

https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=this.path

Updates include:

(1) added this.path::here (similar to here::here), for constructing
the path to a file, starting with the executing script's directory

(2) this.path::this.path is compatible with URLs in base::source, for
example source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArcadeAntics/this.path/main/tests/this.path_w_URLs.R")

(3) added separate methods for extracting the shell argument 'FILE'
for Windows and Unix-alikes (shell arguments are handled slightly
differently between the two)

(4) on Windows, in Rgui, added support for all languages listed by
list.dirs(system.file(package = "translations"), full.names = FALSE,
recursive = FALSE)

If you're using version 0.4.4 or less, it is well worth upgrading.

Message-ID: <CAMcXZtE84BN-Nbn_e6bm-w-UJUSjzVxC9Q7at4mkh72dzHUWDg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

latex2exp is an R package to use a subset of LaTeX to create formatted
text and mathematical formulas and symbols. It can be used for axis
labels, annotations, legends, titles, etc. throughout R?s plotting
system and ggplot2.

A call to TeX() such as `TeX(r"(\textbf{Euler's identity} is $e^{i\pi}
+ 1 = 0$.)")` will return an expression containing the formatted text
and equation, suitable for plotting. latex2exp works by parsing the
provided LaTeX string and converting it to R's plotmath expressions.

A new major version of latex2exp (0.9.0), containing a rewritten
parser, tens of new commands and symbols, and many bug fixes, is now
available on CRAN:
https://cran.r-project.org/package=latex2exp

A website for the package, with examples, vignettes, and a searchable
table of supported LaTeX commands, is available at:
https://stefano-meschiari.github.io/latex2exp

Finally, issues should be reported at:
https://github.com/stefano-meschiari/latex2exp/

Best regards,
Stefano

 Values
Message-ID: <CABxkZL5b3Vfa=Q44iAgwQ0T6gK8BNU8W_3o_vzyb=azx=+t46g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have recently released a new package "naflex" on CRAN:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/naflex/index.html.

"naflex" provides helper functions that give additional flexibility for
handling missing values in summary functions (beyond the current extremes
of na.rm = TRUE/FALSE).

For example, allow up to 20% of values to be missing:

library(naflex)
library(magrittr)
x <- c(1, 3, NA, 4, 3, 2, NA, 5, 8, 7)
mean(x %>% na_omit_if(prop = 0.2))
# 4.125
mean(x %>% na_omit_if(prop = 0.1))
# NA

Please see the package details or vignette for the full set of checks
available.

I hope this may be of use to some as a convenient way to work with various
missing value rules.

Feedback, suggestions and bug reports are welcome at
https://github.com/dannyparsons/naflex or by email
(danny at idems.international)

Best regards,

Danny Parsons

Subject: [R-pkgs] spacejamr v0.2
Message-ID: <031e01d81a06$4fa88600$eef99200$@gmail.com>

Dear R users,

 

I am pleased to announce that v0.2 of the spacejamr package is now available
on CRAN.  This package enables social network analysis when social network
data is unavailable. spacejamr simulates points from a spatial point process
or sequence in a user-specified spatial window, converts distances between
points into tie formation probabilities, and outputs an igraph object that
can be analyzed with normal network analysis methods. In addition, the
package includes plotting methods for spatial boundaries, point processes,
and social networks.

 

Some changes to this version are:

 

            * Users can decide whether to use the coordinate reference
system in the supplied shapefile or let the as.spacejamr() method find the
best projected CRS.

    

             * spacejamr no longer depends on the methods package.

    

            * In line with new versions of the spatstat metapackage,
spacejamr now calls functions from spatstat.random to simulate spatial point
processes.

 

Please check it out here:

https://cran.r-project.org/package=spacejamr

 

For more details on the methodology used in the package see:

Carter T. Butts, (2002, ISBN:978-0-493-72676-2), "Spatial models of
large-scale interpersonal networks."

 

Best regards,

 

Darren Colby

Dear R users

There is an update of openSTARS available on CRAN (now version 1.2.3), 
fixing some problems in correct_complex_confluences.

openSTARS provides GIS functionalities to delineate streams from DEMs, 
derive catchments of sampling sites along streams and intersect with 
potential covariates of stream monitoring data. It also prepares the 
data to be further processed by geostatistical regression models using ssn.

All the best,

Hi all,

just to inform you that the 'footBayes' package (version 0.1.0) is now on CRAN:

 https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=footBayes<https://cran.r-project.org/package=footBayes>

The package wants to be the most comprehensive tool for the football (soccer) modelling ecosystem.
As such, it allows the estimation, the visualization and the prediction for the most
well-known football (soccer) models, according to the references:

Dixon and Coles (1997) <doi:10.1111/1467-9876.00065>,
Karlis and Ntzoufras (2003) <doi:10.1111/1467-9884.00366> and
Egidi, Pauli and Torelli (2018) <doi:10.1177/1471082X18798414>.

In brief, the goal of ```footBayes``` is to propose a complete workflow to:

- fit the most well-known football models: double Poisson, bivariate Poisson, Skellam, student-t, according to both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods (+ Hamiltonian Monte Carlo engine);

- visualize the teams' abilities, the model checks, the rank-league reconstruction;

- predict out-of-sample matches.

Try the package now and enjoy!
Best.
