Subject: [R-pkgs] PDtoolkit: Collection of Tools for PD Rating Model
 Development
Message-ID: <CABcwgRRDj=V=CUp5gg=vHawRzGLXKy_uLFQMWxcyM0TsHZzhPg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

I am happy to announce that my new package PDtoolkit is now available on
CRAN.

The goal of this package is to cover the most common steps in probability
of default (PD) rating model development and validation. The main
procedures available are those that refer to univariate, bivariate,
multivariate analysis, calibration and validation. Along with accompanied
monobin and monobinShiny packages, PDtoolkit provides functions which are
suitable for different data transformation and modeling tasks such as:
imputations, monotonic binning of numeric risk factors, binning of
categorical risk factors, weights of evidence (WoE) and information value
(IV) calculations, WoE coding (replacement of risk factors modalities with
WoE values), risk factor clustering, area under curve (AUC) calculation and
others. Additionally, package provides set of validation functions for
testing homogeneity, heterogeneity, discriminatory and predictive power of
the model.

For details and examples please check out the github page
https://github.com/andrija-djurovic/PDtoolkit  or README file on CRAN page
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PDtoolkit

Best regards,
Andrija Djurovic

Dear R users,

It is now possible to create and annotate Holdridge life zone plots using
functions modelled on the standard graphics package using the the package
"Ternary", whose v2.0 release is now available from CRAN:
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Ternary .
The vignette at https://ms609.github.io/Ternary/articles/Holdridge.html gives
an example and pointers to detailed documentation.

Ternary 2.0 also includes a complete 'shiny' graphical user interface to
allow interactive construction of ternary plots without detailed knowledge
of R.

Regards,

Martin Smith

Subject: [R-pkgs] Package "Rogue": Detect wildcard taxa in sets of
 phylogenetic trees
Message-ID: <CANotEPuHoVPYJ9W35rQniFmB035fD5Mf-axwUMFv-_T-V-jOYA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

Package "Rogue" has been published on CRAN:
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rogue.

"Rogue" improves phylogenetic analysis by detecting wildcard taxa whose
inconsistent position reduces split support and resolution in consensus
trees.  It implements an effective new information-theoretic approach
(Smith 2022, https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syab099), and provides an R
interface to the established "RogueNaRok" C library (Aberer et al. 2013,
https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/sys078).

A vignette demonstrating use on Bayesian posterior tree sets can be found
at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rogue/vignettes/Bayesian.html.
Questions and bug reports are welcome at https://github.com/ms609/Rogue.

Regards,

Martin Smith

Subject: [R-pkgs] Analysis of phylogenetic datasets in R: package
 "TreeSearch"
Message-ID: <CANotEPvuOsnHr1qihG5KAJ-BPjYRLC+2OA2e06xY=hCSzZyujA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

TreeSearch is an R package for phylogenetic analysis, optimized for
morphological datasets. Tree search may be conducted using under equal or
implied step weights with an explicit (albeit inexact) allowance for
inapplicable character entries, avoiding some of the pitfalls inherent in
standard parsimony methods. Profile parsimony and user-specified optimality
criteria are supported.

A graphical interface, which requires no familiarity with R, is designed to
help a user to improve the quality of datasets through critical review of
underpinning character codings; and to obtain additional information from
results by identifying and summarising clusters of similar trees, mapping
the distribution of trees, and removing ?rogue? taxa that obscure
underlying relationships.

Taken together, the package aims to support methodological rigour at each
step of data collection, analysis, and the exploration of phylogenetic
results.

A stable release of TreeSearch is now on CRAN:
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TreeSearch

An introduction to the package is provided in the vignette:
https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/articles/tree-search.html

Further details are in the BioR?iv preprint:
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.08.467735

Regards,

Martin

Subject: [R-pkgs] Package "steprf": Stepwise Predictive Variable Selection
 for Random Forest
Message-ID: <CAGu_3ZJqN4W1jYDx0VJZSGmqUn-JK5OaWCC_QM5-S-5Y5FW2GQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

A new package "steprf" has been published on CRAN:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/steprf/index.html.

It introduces several novel predictive variable selection methods for
random forest (RF). The selections are based on various
variable  importance methods and predictive accuracy in stepwise
algorithms. Their performance can be seen in the references cited in the
description of the package.

Subject: [R-pkgs] this.path-package: get executing script's path
Message-ID: <CAPcHnpR7sUAxvQ6D-K4vmdkay8gC91Z4EcAhU3Efbz3isyP7pA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,


R package 'this.path' has received an update, the current version
number is 0.5.0
You can find this package at:

https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=this.path

Updates include:

(1) added this.path::here (similar to here::here), for constructing
the path to a file, starting with the executing script's directory

(2) this.path::this.path is compatible with URLs in base::source, for
example source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArcadeAntics/this.path/main/tests/this.path_w_URLs.R")

(3) added separate methods for extracting the shell argument 'FILE'
for Windows and Unix-alikes (shell arguments are handled slightly
differently between the two)

(4) on Windows, in Rgui, added support for all languages listed by
list.dirs(system.file(package = "translations"), full.names = FALSE,
recursive = FALSE)

If you're using version 0.4.4 or less, it is well worth upgrading.


Regards,
    Andrew Simmons

Subject: [R-pkgs] latex2exp 0.9.0: Use LaTeX Expressions in Plots
Message-ID: <CAMcXZtE84BN-Nbn_e6bm-w-UJUSjzVxC9Q7at4mkh72dzHUWDg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

latex2exp is an R package to use a subset of LaTeX to create formatted
text and mathematical formulas and symbols. It can be used for axis
labels, annotations, legends, titles, etc. throughout R?s plotting
system and ggplot2.

A call to TeX() such as `TeX(r"(\textbf{Euler's identity} is $e^{i\pi}
+ 1 = 0$.)")` will return an expression containing the formatted text
and equation, suitable for plotting. latex2exp works by parsing the
provided LaTeX string and converting it to R's plotmath expressions.

A new major version of latex2exp (0.9.0), containing a rewritten
parser, tens of new commands and symbols, and many bug fixes, is now
available on CRAN:
https://cran.r-project.org/package=latex2exp

A website for the package, with examples, vignettes, and a searchable
table of supported LaTeX commands, is available at:
https://stefano-meschiari.github.io/latex2exp

Finally, issues should be reported at:
https://github.com/stefano-meschiari/latex2exp/

Best regards,
Stefano
