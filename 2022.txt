 Development
Message-ID: <CABcwgRRDj=V=CUp5gg=vHawRzGLXKy_uLFQMWxcyM0TsHZzhPg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

I am happy to announce that my new package PDtoolkit is now available on
CRAN.

The goal of this package is to cover the most common steps in probability
of default (PD) rating model development and validation. The main
procedures available are those that refer to univariate, bivariate,
multivariate analysis, calibration and validation. Along with accompanied
monobin and monobinShiny packages, PDtoolkit provides functions which are
suitable for different data transformation and modeling tasks such as:
imputations, monotonic binning of numeric risk factors, binning of
categorical risk factors, weights of evidence (WoE) and information value
(IV) calculations, WoE coding (replacement of risk factors modalities with
WoE values), risk factor clustering, area under curve (AUC) calculation and
others. Additionally, package provides set of validation functions for
testing homogeneity, heterogeneity, discriminatory and predictive power of
the model.

For details and examples please check out the github page
https://github.com/andrija-djurovic/PDtoolkit  or README file on CRAN page
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PDtoolkit

Best regards,
Andrija Djurovic

 phylogenetic trees
Message-ID: <CANotEPuHoVPYJ9W35rQniFmB035fD5Mf-axwUMFv-_T-V-jOYA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

Package "Rogue" has been published on CRAN:
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rogue.

"Rogue" improves phylogenetic analysis by detecting wildcard taxa whose
inconsistent position reduces split support and resolution in consensus
trees.  It implements an effective new information-theoretic approach
(Smith 2022, https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syab099), and provides an R
interface to the established "RogueNaRok" C library (Aberer et al. 2013,
https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/sys078).

A vignette demonstrating use on Bayesian posterior tree sets can be found
at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rogue/vignettes/Bayesian.html.
Questions and bug reports are welcome at https://github.com/ms609/Rogue.

Regards,

Martin Smith

 "TreeSearch"
Message-ID: <CANotEPvuOsnHr1qihG5KAJ-BPjYRLC+2OA2e06xY=hCSzZyujA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

TreeSearch is an R package for phylogenetic analysis, optimized for
morphological datasets. Tree search may be conducted using under equal or
implied step weights with an explicit (albeit inexact) allowance for
inapplicable character entries, avoiding some of the pitfalls inherent in
standard parsimony methods. Profile parsimony and user-specified optimality
criteria are supported.

A graphical interface, which requires no familiarity with R, is designed to
help a user to improve the quality of datasets through critical review of
underpinning character codings; and to obtain additional information from
results by identifying and summarising clusters of similar trees, mapping
the distribution of trees, and removing ?rogue? taxa that obscure
underlying relationships.

Taken together, the package aims to support methodological rigour at each
step of data collection, analysis, and the exploration of phylogenetic
results.

A stable release of TreeSearch is now on CRAN:
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TreeSearch

An introduction to the package is provided in the vignette:
https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/articles/tree-search.html

Further details are in the BioR?iv preprint:
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.08.467735

Martin

Hello everyone,


R package 'this.path' has received an update, the current version
number is 0.5.0
You can find this package at:

https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=this.path

Updates include:

(1) added this.path::here (similar to here::here), for constructing
the path to a file, starting with the executing script's directory

(2) this.path::this.path is compatible with URLs in base::source, for
example source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArcadeAntics/this.path/main/tests/this.path_w_URLs.R")

(3) added separate methods for extracting the shell argument 'FILE'
for Windows and Unix-alikes (shell arguments are handled slightly
differently between the two)

(4) on Windows, in Rgui, added support for all languages listed by
list.dirs(system.file(package = "translations"), full.names = FALSE,
recursive = FALSE)

If you're using version 0.4.4 or less, it is well worth upgrading.

Message-ID: <CAMcXZtE84BN-Nbn_e6bm-w-UJUSjzVxC9Q7at4mkh72dzHUWDg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

latex2exp is an R package to use a subset of LaTeX to create formatted
text and mathematical formulas and symbols. It can be used for axis
labels, annotations, legends, titles, etc. throughout R?s plotting
system and ggplot2.

A call to TeX() such as `TeX(r"(\textbf{Euler's identity} is $e^{i\pi}
+ 1 = 0$.)")` will return an expression containing the formatted text
and equation, suitable for plotting. latex2exp works by parsing the
provided LaTeX string and converting it to R's plotmath expressions.

A new major version of latex2exp (0.9.0), containing a rewritten
parser, tens of new commands and symbols, and many bug fixes, is now
available on CRAN:
https://cran.r-project.org/package=latex2exp

A website for the package, with examples, vignettes, and a searchable
table of supported LaTeX commands, is available at:
https://stefano-meschiari.github.io/latex2exp

Finally, issues should be reported at:
https://github.com/stefano-meschiari/latex2exp/

Best regards,
Stefano

 Values
Message-ID: <CABxkZL5b3Vfa=Q44iAgwQ0T6gK8BNU8W_3o_vzyb=azx=+t46g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have recently released a new package "naflex" on CRAN:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/naflex/index.html.

"naflex" provides helper functions that give additional flexibility for
handling missing values in summary functions (beyond the current extremes
of na.rm = TRUE/FALSE).

For example, allow up to 20% of values to be missing:

library(naflex)
library(magrittr)
x <- c(1, 3, NA, 4, 3, 2, NA, 5, 8, 7)
mean(x %>% na_omit_if(prop = 0.2))
# 4.125
mean(x %>% na_omit_if(prop = 0.1))
# NA

Please see the package details or vignette for the full set of checks
available.

I hope this may be of use to some as a convenient way to work with various
missing value rules.

Feedback, suggestions and bug reports are welcome at
https://github.com/dannyparsons/naflex or by email
(danny at idems.international)

Best regards,

Danny Parsons

Subject: [R-pkgs] spacejamr v0.2
Message-ID: <031e01d81a06$4fa88600$eef99200$@gmail.com>

Dear R users,

 

I am pleased to announce that v0.2 of the spacejamr package is now available
on CRAN.  This package enables social network analysis when social network
data is unavailable. spacejamr simulates points from a spatial point process
or sequence in a user-specified spatial window, converts distances between
points into tie formation probabilities, and outputs an igraph object that
can be analyzed with normal network analysis methods. In addition, the
package includes plotting methods for spatial boundaries, point processes,
and social networks.

 

Some changes to this version are:

 

            * Users can decide whether to use the coordinate reference
system in the supplied shapefile or let the as.spacejamr() method find the
best projected CRS.

    

             * spacejamr no longer depends on the methods package.

    

            * In line with new versions of the spatstat metapackage,
spacejamr now calls functions from spatstat.random to simulate spatial point
processes.

 

Please check it out here:

https://cran.r-project.org/package=spacejamr

 

For more details on the methodology used in the package see:

Carter T. Butts, (2002, ISBN:978-0-493-72676-2), "Spatial models of
large-scale interpersonal networks."

 

Best regards,

 

Darren Colby

There is an update of openSTARS available on CRAN (now version 1.2.3), 
fixing some problems in correct_complex_confluences.

openSTARS provides GIS functionalities to delineate streams from DEMs, 
derive catchments of sampling sites along streams and intersect with 
potential covariates of stream monitoring data. It also prepares the 
data to be further processed by geostatistical regression models using ssn.

All the best,

Hi all,

just to inform you that the 'footBayes' package (version 0.1.0) is now on CRAN:

 https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=footBayes<https://cran.r-project.org/package=footBayes>

The package wants to be the most comprehensive tool for the football (soccer) modelling ecosystem.
As such, it allows the estimation, the visualization and the prediction for the most
well-known football (soccer) models, according to the references:

Dixon and Coles (1997) <doi:10.1111/1467-9876.00065>,
Karlis and Ntzoufras (2003) <doi:10.1111/1467-9884.00366> and
Egidi, Pauli and Torelli (2018) <doi:10.1177/1471082X18798414>.

In brief, the goal of ```footBayes``` is to propose a complete workflow to:

- fit the most well-known football models: double Poisson, bivariate Poisson, Skellam, student-t, according to both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods (+ Hamiltonian Monte Carlo engine);

- visualize the teams' abilities, the model checks, the rank-league reconstruction;

- predict out-of-sample matches.

Try the package now and enjoy!
Best.

Dear community,

Version 0.12 of the package declared has just made it on CRAN.

Apart from the usual functions to declare labels for regular and missing
values, this version has a suite of new functions to calculate various
weighted frequencies and summaries.

The weighted versions are heavily inspired from the base R packages and
other established contributed ones, but adapted to objects of class

sentiment.ai  does sentiment analysis via deep learning (with tensorflow) and gradient boosting models with a lot of the underlying hassle taken care of to make the process as simple as possible. In addition to out-performing traditional, lexicon-based sentiment analysis, and even Azure Cognitive Services (see https://benwiseman.github.io/sentiment.ai/#Benchmarks), it also allows the user to create embedding vectors for text (via Google's U.S.E.) which can be used in other analyses (e.g. text similarity). What's more is that the community can contribute better sentiment scoring models to make sentiment analysis in R get better and better over time. Our aim is to make sentiment analysis more consistently good for all people with as little hassle as possible. GPU acceleration via NVIDIA CUDA is supported on Windows and Linux.

To install the package, run:
install.packages("sentiment.ai")
# followed by
sentiment.ai::install_sentiment.ai() # to set up python/tensorflow dependencies

Subject: [R-pkgs] surveyCV: cross validation based on survey design
Message-ID: <CAKRVze+TD-bbDVdE4usEEj5CLi_ZxMcNgPwdoJuo7QJswVOsmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

I have released a new package on CRAN:

`surveyCV`: Cross Validation Based on Survey Design
https://cran.r-project.org/package=surveyCV

Following the design-based framework used in survey sampling, we
provide functions to generate K-fold cross validation (CV) folds and
CV test error estimates that are able to account for many common
sampling designs (SRS, clustering, stratification, and/or unequal
sampling weights). The sampling design can be specified directly or
provided as a `svydesign` object from the `survey` package.

For linear or logistic regression, the function `cv.svy()` carries out
the entire CV process: generate folds, train fitted models, and
calculate estimates of test error and their SEs, all while respecting
the sampling design.
For other model types, the function `folds.svy()` partitions your
dataset into K folds that respect any stratification and clustering in
the sampling design, so that these folds can be used in your own
custom CV loop.

Please see our package's README and `intro` vignette for examples:
https://github.com/ColbyStatSvyRsch/surveyCV/#readme
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/surveyCV/vignettes/intro.html

For further details on the methodology, please see:
Wieczorek, Guerin, and McMahon (2022), "K-Fold Cross-Validation for
Complex Sample Surveys," *Stat* <doi:10.1002/sta4.454>
https://doi.org/10.1002/sta4.454

Feedback is welcome by email or at:
https://github.com/ColbyStatSvyRsch/surveyCV/issues

Best wishes,
Jerzy Wieczorek

PS -- The package was originally released in January as v0.1.1, but it
was not announced here until now that the more feature-complete v0.2.0
is available.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Nmix package - Bayesian inference about univariate
 Gaussian mixtures with an unknown number of components
Message-ID: <d52bf841-0a15-ba10-6585-155a33be35e9@bristol.ac.uk>

This package is now on CRAN in version 2.0.2, and anyone interested in 
inference on mixture models, or more generally in Bayesian inference for 
"trans-dimensional" problems, is encouraged to try it out. The 
methodology is that presented by Richardson and Green in our 1997 
article in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, using 
Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo. The package is based on the 
Fortran code used in the research for that paper, which is available now 
to the R user for the first time. A rich variety of outputs from the 
MCMC sample path is available, optionally, and many features of the 
posterior distribution are presented graphically. Apart from its direct 
use in analysing data, the package might be useful in supporting 
learning about Bayesian computation.

Feedback is most welcome, and I may be open to extending the 
functionality of the package in response to concrete suggestions.

regards,

Peter Green

Dear R users,


I am happy to announce that my new package shadowr is now available on
CRAN.

The package enables to use the shadow selenium plugin<https://github.com/sukgu/shadow-automation-selenium> to manage multi level shadow DOM elements on web page.

Shadow DOM is a web standard that offers component style and markup encapsulation.

It is a critically important piece of the Web Components story as it ensures that a component will work in

any environment even if other CSS or JavaScript is at play on the page.

The problem is that Custom HTML tags can?t be directly identified with selenium tools.

If you just need to click a cookie accept button and if there is only a one level shadow dom structure,

you could just copy the js path and let the selenium driver execute this js code.

For details and examples please check out the github page.

But when you have a multi level shadow dom structure and have to do different things with the elements like get the text or click them,

sooner or later things get complicated.

You would have to handle a lot of long strings and depending on the action and amount of elements also modify/extend the strings.

Shadowr enable R users a more comfortable and reliable way to work with shadow dom elements.

Subject: [R-pkgs] {CIPerm}: Computationally-Efficient Confidence Intervals
 for Mean Shift from Permutation Methods
Message-ID: <CAKRVzeL7Sx=xqTCNrAd2CRk+EAq4jVgpwayKKiFeEk8PNST6YA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

Emily Tupaj and I recently released a new package on CRAN:

{CIPerm}: Computationally-Efficient Confidence Intervals
for Mean Shift from Permutation Methods
https://cran.r-project.org/package=CIPerm

Problem:
It is straightforward to carry out a permutation or randomization test of
H_0: mu_A - mu_B = 0
but the "naive" approach to getting a confidence interval for the mean
shift parameter
(mu_A - mu_B)
is more computationally-intensive. In this "naive" approach we would test
H_0: mu_A - mu_B = delta
for many values of delta, and let our CI be the delta values where we
did not reject H_0. This requires running a new permutation test for
each candidate value of delta.

Our contribution:
Instead of the naive approach, our R package implements an exact
method derived by Minh Nguyen (2009) to calculate such confidence
interval endpoints from a single set of permutations. Thus, it is no
more computationally expensive than a single standard permutation
test.

Please see our package's README and `nguyen` vignette for examples and
a brief overview of the method:
https://github.com/ColbyStatSvyRsch/CIPerm#readme
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CIPerm/vignettes/nguyen.html

Our `naive` vignette contains timing tests to compare the
computational speeds of Nguyen's method against the naive approach.
For large datasets, Nguyen's method is substantially faster:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CIPerm/vignettes/naive.html

For details on the methodology, please see:
Nguyen, M.D. (2009). "Nonparametric Inference using Randomization and
Permutation Reference Distribution and their Monte-Carlo
Approximation" [unpublished MS thesis; Mara Tableman, advisor],
Portland State University. Dissertations and Theses. Paper 5927.

Subject: [R-pkgs] TDApplied: Machine Learning and Inference for Topological
 Data Analysis
Message-ID: <CAESJsLvGMY_YJe6fkWgSZAsASGgGeZ8SHD5=NAyjOhCqpFCjug@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

I am very excited to announce my new package TDApplied is now available on
CRAN.

Topological data analysis is a powerful tool for finding non-linear global
structure in whole datasets. 'TDApplied' aims to bridge topological data
analysis with data, statistical and machine learning practitioners so that
more analyses may benefit from the power of topological data analysis. The
main tool of topological data analysis is persistent homology, which
computes a shape descriptor of a dataset, called a persistence diagram.
There are three goals of this package: (1) convert persistence diagrams
computed using the two main R packages for topological data analysis into a
data frame, (2) implement fast versions of both distance and kernel
calculations for pairs of persistence diagrams, and (3) provide scalable
methods for machine learning and inference for persistence diagrams.

For details and examples please check out the github page
https://github.com/shaelebrown/TDApplied or the README file on CRAN
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TDApplied/readme/README.html

I sincerely hope that you will enjoy using this package and that it helps
the field of topological data analysis progress in both academia and
industry.

Best regards,
Shael

Subject: [R-pkgs] CohensdpLibrary: Compute Cohen's d and its confidence
 interval in any experimental design
Message-ID: <0175872f-a228-5b53-f9df-0b4bd6e69d18@uottawa.ca>

Dear all,

If you are using Cohen's d, this package is for you. The package "CohensdpLibrary" lets you compute Cohen's d from basic statistics and also get confidence intervals. It expands on MBESS as it is available for data obtained in within-subject designs as well as between-subject designs.

It is based on a simple command, e. g.,

Cohensdp( statistics = list(m1=76, m2=72, n=20, s1=14.8, s2=18.8, r=0.2),
          design = "within"
)

Sincerely,
Denis Cousineau.
