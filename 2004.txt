Subject: [R-pkgs] New version of eha
Message-ID: <20040108092150.GA1179@stat.umu.se>

A new version of 'eha' (0.92-1) is now on CRAN. From the ChangeLog:

0.92-1 (January 7, 2004)
	
	* mlreg: Geometric distribution (i.e., constant baseline discrete
	hazard) added. Not for frailty models, yet (on the TODO list).

	* mlreg: New argument, 'n.points', added to 'control'. Controls
	the number of points used in the Gauss-Hermite quadrature.

	* mlreg: Stricter control of numerical problems, especially in the
	frailty fit.
	
	* clean: Replaced by the new functions check.spells and join.spells.

	* Return values changed to conform with R-1.8.0 (and later).

Subject: [R-pkgs] new version of randomForest (4.0-7)
Message-ID: <3A822319EB35174CA3714066D590DCD504AF75EB@usrymx25.merck.com>

Dear R users,

I've just released a new version of randomForest (available on CRAN now).
This version contained quite a number of new features and bug fixes,
compared to version prior to 4.0-x (and few more since 4.0-1).

For those not familiar with randomForest, it's an ensemble
classifier/regression tool.  Please see
http://www.math.usu.edu/~adele/forests/ for more detailed information, as
well as the Fortran code.

Comments/questions/bugs reports/patches much appreciated! 

A few notes about the new version:

o  There is a new tuneRF() function for searching for the optimal mtry,
following Breiman's suggestion.  PLEASE use it to see if result can be
improved!

o  A new variable importance measure replaces the one based on margin.  This
new measure is the same as in Breiman's V5.  The analogous measure is also
implemented for regression.  This new measure is designed to be more robust
against data where predictor variables have very different number of
possible splits (i.e., unique values/categories).  The previous measure
tends to make variables with more possible splits look more important.

o  For classification, the new meassure is also computed on a per-class
basis.

o  There is the new `sampsize' option for down-sampling larger classes.
E.g., if in a two-class problem, there are 950 class 1s and 50 class 2s, use
sampsize=c(50, 50) will usually give a more `balanced' classifier.

o  There is a new importance() function for extracting the importance
measure.

o  The predict() method has an option to return predictions by the component
trees.

o  There is a new getTree() function for looking at one of the trees in the
forest. 

o  For dealing with missing values in the predictor variables, there are
na.roughfix() and rfImpute(), which correspond to the `missquick' and
`missright' options in Breiman's V4/V5 code.  Both works for classification
as well as regression.

o  There is an experimental bias reduction step in regression (the corr.bias
argument in randomForest) that could be very effective for some data (but
essentially no effect for some others).


Some notes about differences between the package and Breiman's Fortran code:

o  Breiman uses the class weights to cast weighted votes.  This is not done
in the R version.  However, one can use the threshold argument to
randomForest to get similar (but not exactly the same) effect.

o  In Breiman's V4/V5 code, the Gini-based importance is weighted by the
out-of-bag data.  This has not been implemented in the R version.

o  Breiman's V4/V5 code can handle categorical predictors with more than 32
categories.  This has not been implemented in the R version.

o  Breiman's classification code uses mtry differently than the R version:
the mtry variables are sampled *with replacement* at each node.  The R
version samples without replacement, so that if mtry is set to number of
predictors, one gets the same result as bagging.  Breiman's regression code
*does* sample the variables without replacement.

o  In the R version, ties are randomly broken when finding best variables,
or when making predictions.  In Breiman's code, the first one found wins.

o  The `prototypes' Breiman described have not been implemented.  There are
situations when they can be misleading, so I have chosen not to implement
it.

o  The `interaction detection' feature in Breiman's V5 has not been
implemented (but is fairly high on my to-do list).


Best,
Andy

AlgDesign is a new package for calculating algorithmic experimental

variety of criteria. It will handle very large designs. It will also
block designs in a variety of ways, including split plotting. You should
find it at least as capable as other software for this purpose.

I'd normally submit this sort of thing to beta test, but I guess the R
users are the beta testers, so have at it. It would probably be best to
send the bug reports directly to me rather then clutter up the newsgroups.

Message-ID: <16437.32492.977572.998974@musil.localdomain>


We would like to announce the availability on CRAN of a new package
multinomRob.  It does robust estimation of overdispersed multinomial
regression models. The package is also able to estimate overdispersed
grouped multinomial logistic and multivariate-t logistic models.  The
code is relatively general; for example, it allows for equality
constraints across parameters and it can handle datasets in which the
number of categories varies by observation.

DESCRIPTION:

Package: multinomRob

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package -- mvpart
Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.2.20040217102016.01d808f8@mail.aims.gov.au>

The package mvpart is now available.
mvpart includes partitioning based on (1) multivariate numeric responses and
(2) dissimilarity matrices.

The package mvpart is a modification of rpart --
  -- authors of original: Terry M Therneau and Beth Atkinson 
<atkinson at mayo.edu>, and
  R port of rpart Brian Ripley <ripley at stats.ox.ac.uk>.
Includes some modified routines from vegan -- Jari Oksanen 
<jari.oksanen at oulu.fi>

Thanks and credit to all the above.

Modifications of rpart to mvpart by Glenn De'ath <g.death at aims.gov.au>.

It was not possible to simply build a separate packge which required RPART due
to the modifications to the rpart C-code necessary to include the 2 new
partitioning methods.

As few changes as possible have been made to rpart.

In addition to the changes in the C-code, the following changes and 
additions in
R-functions have been made.

(1) A wrapper function for rpart called mvpart supports selection of trees 
by x-validation,
         interactive display, printing of results etc.

(2) Some multivariate methods to deal with representation and 
interpretation of multivariate
         partitioning objects have been added. These include PCA plots and 
tree-cluster comparisons.

(3) Methods for calculating increased forms of dissimilarities and for 
scaling matrices
         have been added. These are designed in particluar for community 
ecology.

(3) text.rpart has been modified to include graphical annotation of nodes.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Package "ref" implements references and referenceable
	data.frames for the S-language
Message-ID: <17540.1077553011@www6.gmx.net>


Repeatedly people have asked how to pass arguments by reference in R.

Now package "ref"  is on CRAN, which provides two referencing methods:

Functions ref(), deref() and friends conveniently allow to pass parameters
"by reference" instead of  "by value". This can be useful in memory critical
applications but requires a more careful programming style to track the
implications of functions changing their parameters. However, package ref is
written in pure S and attaching this package does not change any standard S
behaviour. 

Class refdata is a transparent wrapper to matrices and data.frames which
allows for memory efficient nested subsetting. I.e. you can create a subset
of a
subset ... of a data.frame without duplicating the data in memory, instead
only indexing information is duplicated. Indexing information is represented
as positive or negative integers, whatever is shorter, thus the length of
the
index is granted to be <=nrows/2 resp. <=ncol/2. Memory savings in case of a
square data.frame is roughly n^2-n elements per level of nested subsetting.

This code is offered "as is" under the GPL, usage is completely at your own
risk. (Some efforts has been put in the included regression tests to make
shure
the code does what it is intended to do).

Feedback about problems or successful example uses is welcome.
Please use the email address given in the package DESCRIPTION and please
don't cc to lists for spam prevention.

Message-ID: <1078931928.2622.36.camel@chomsky.estadi.uv.es>

Dear R users,

I am glad to announce the release of a new package for R: DCluster. It
implements a number of methods for the detection of clusters of disease.
It includes methods to test Poisson extra-variation (Chi-square test and
Potthoff-Whittinghill's test), Spatial Autocorrelation (Moran's I and
Geary's c), general clustering (Whittermore's statistic and Tango's
statistic), scan methods (Openshaw's GAM, Besag & Newell's methods and
Kulldorff & Nagarwalla's statistic) and a focused test (Stone's Test).

Bootstrap is used to estimate significance and a number of models are
proposed to simulate data: permutations and Poisson, Multinomial or Neg.
Binomial distributions.

I hope the package will be useful to epidemiologists and statisticians
involved in spatial epidemiological studies. As usual, feedback and
comments are welcome. Our hope is to improve the package, so suggestions
about new methods to be added are of interest.

With best regards,

Subject: [R-pkgs] Subselect package - Version 0.7.1
Message-ID: <E1B1P1l-0003PO-00@DMjcadima>


A new  version (0.7.1) of package 'subselect' has been uploaded to CRAN.

Package 'subselect' provides functions which assess the quality of
variable subsets as surrogates for a full data set, in an exploratory
data analysis, and search for subsets which are optimal under various
criteria. 

As of version 0.7 a new function 'leaps' has been added. 'Leaps'
performs a branch and bound search for the best variable subsets,
according to a specified criterion. 'Leaps' implements Duarte Silva's
adaptation (Reference 3) of Furnival and Wilson's Leaps and Bounds
Algorithm for variable selection in Regression Analysis. It is viable in
identifying optimal subsets for data sets with a moderate number
(up to about 30-35) of variables, and very fast for small data sets
(up to about 20-25 variables).

In package subselect, the quality of given k-subsets of variables are
assessed under three criteria (Reference 2). 

Three additional functions, 'anneal', 'genetic' and 'improve', search for
optimal k-variable subsets under those criteria, using three different
algorithms: a simulated annealing algorithm, a genetic algorithm and a
restricted local improvement algorithm (Reference 1). Among the
options, the user can control number of iterations, initial
temperature, cooling factors and cooling frequency in simulated
annealing, and number of generations, population size, admissibility
of clones and presence and frequency of mutations in the 
genetic algorithm. 

For all algorithms, it is possible to specify the number
of solutions required in one or more cardinalities and to force the solutions 
to include and/or to exclude given subsets of variables.


Here is the DESCRIPTION file for the package:

Message-ID: <C4178DC99E08604EA5E2BDB989F09380090C8D@EXTAS2-HBA.tas.csiro.au>

Dear R users

New versions of the 'mvbutils' and 'debug' packages are now available on CRAN, both in source form and as precompiled binaries.

'mvbutils' offers the following (as well as many miscellaneous utilities):

  ?  hiearchical, searchable project organization, with workspaces switchable inside a single R session, and objects in "ancestor" projects always visible in R from "child" projects;
  ?  function editing (interface to text editors), with multiple simultaneous edits, an "unfrozen" R prompt, and automatic backup;
  ?  function code and plain-text documentation stored in the same R object, and editable in the same file;
  ?  informal plain-text documentation via help, and conversion to Rd format;
  ?  nested 'source'ing, and interspersal of R code and data in the same file;
  ?  macro-like functions, executing inside their caller's environment;
  ?  untangling and display of "what calls what" within groups of functions.

'debug' is for debugging functions (yours or other people's). It requires 'mvbutils'. 'debug' offers:

  ?  a visible code window with line-numbered code and highlighted execution point;
  ?  the ability to set (conditional) breakpoints in advance, at any line number;
  ?  the opportunity to keep going after errors;
  ?  multiple debugging windows open at once (when one debuggee calls another, or itself);
  ?  full debugging of 'on.exit' code;
  ?  the ability to move the execution point around without executing intervening statements;
  ?  direct interpretation of typed-in statements, as if they were in the function itself.

For further information on 'debug', see the article "Debugging without (too many) tears" in R-news 3/3.

The new versions fix a few minor bugs in the 1.0.0 releases, as documented in the CHANGES.TXT files in each package.

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.58.0403161058130.29943@moon.stats.gla.ac.uk>

mgcv 1.0 (package providing gams etc) will be released with R 1.9.0.
(R 1.8.x compatible versions can be found at:
http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/~simon/simon/mgcv.html)
There are quite a few changes from mgcv 0.9: hence this message.

The main new features are:

* A generalized additive mixed modelling function `gamm' (which uses lme
  from the nlme library of glmmPQL from the MASS library for fitting).

* Tensor product smooths as an alternative way of representing smooths of
  more than one variable. These are useful when isotropic smoothing is
  inappropriate. Tensor products of any available smooth can be used.
  See ?te

* An object oriented approach to smooth terms that allows new classes of
  smooths to be added easily. See ?smooth.construct for details and
  example R code implementing `p-splines'.

* A built in cyclic smooth class for terms where the beginning is the
  end...

Partly as a result of the above the code has undergone some fairly major
re-organization, which means that ...

1. The new version is not fully back compatible with previous versions.
   For example version 1.0 plotting or summary functions will not work with
   gam objects from previous versions of mgcv.

2. There's likely to be the odd teething problem - please let me know
   about them so they can get fixed.

Message-ID: <6.0.3.0.2.20040320142045.090d76d8@wheresmymailserver.com>

There is a new version of the abind package on CRAN (abind_1.1-0).  abind() 
is a multi-dimensional generalization of cbind() and rbind() -- it can bind 
multiple 2-d matrices into a 3-d array, or bind 3-d arrays together, etc.

In this new version the behavior of the function abind() has been enhanced 
slightly (it can now accept a list as the first argument, removing the need 
to use do.call() in most situtations), and changed slightly (to no longer 
by default creates dimension names if none exist, because these are usually 
useless and mostly annoying).  There is also a new function in the package: 
adrop(), which does approximately what drop() does, but allows control over 
which dimensions are dropped.

Note also that the abind() function runs under S-plus as well (I believe 
adrop() does as well, but it is not as well tested).

Details:

2004-03-12

         * R/abind.R man/abind.Rd
         allow first argument of abind() to be a list of objects to be
         bound -- this avoids the need for do.call() when one wants to bind
         a list of objects

         * R/abind.R man/abind.Rd
         changed argument name 'use.anon.names' to the more intuitive
         'make.names' (the argument 'use.anon.names' still works)

         * R/abind.R man/abind.Rd
         changed default value for 'make.names' to FALSE (now more closely
         behaves like rbind() and cbind()).  This means that dimension
           names for dimensions that have no names are only constructed
           when requested, not by default.

         * R/adrop.R man/adrop.Rd
         added new function adrop().  This is a function like drop(), but it
           allows to user to specify which of the dimensions with extent one
           will be dropped.


Please let me know of any problems.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Moron v0.6.0b released
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.51.0403271325160.27230@localhost.localdomain>


We are pleased to announce that the development of the
notorious "Method for Object Recognition of Obscure Nature"
(or Moron, for short) has been switched to the R language.

Given a directory of images (i.e. jpegs), Moron attempts
to predict a category distribution for the content of each
image. The default categories modelled are {healthy,pron,
latex/fetish,japanese_cg,manga,b/w photo}. Supposing
good statistical models can be designed for problems
like these, Moron could eventually be usable as a spam filter
for visual data or to sort images, depending on your taste.
Currently it is not accurate enough for production use.

The Moron package contains a data.frame to estimate a
model to recognize the default categories, and source code
to evaluate new images, collect new training sets (this
can be done simply by putting images of different classes
to different directories and running a few provided functions)
and train new classifiers. The included Local Binary Pattern
(LBP) feature extractors and RGB<->HSV conversion routines
might be of aside interest.

Due to its ability to visualize the predictions made
per image region, Moron is a guaranteed hit in both
parties and classrooms, if only given a juicy enough set
of test images. Even layman (male) audience has been
seen to be captivated by the antics of Moron, efficiently
rivalling traditional aquariums and fireplaces.

Moron is released under GPL. Version 0.6.0b for R can be dl'ed from

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7434&package_id=68958

The package relies on R libraries 'randomForest' and 'pixmap'.
It has been developed on Linux, but is probably usable on
other systems with only a few simple modifications.


Have fun,
Igor

Subject: [R-pkgs] energy 1.0.1
Message-ID: <p04310101bc909e38eb73@[129.1.87.58]>


R Users,

We would like to announce that Version 1.0.1 of the energy package is
now available on CRAN.

The energy package introduces a new class of statistical tests based
on the concept of Newton's potential energy. Included in the package are

    * mvnorm.etest (test) and mvnorm.e (statistic)
      A rotation invariant multivariate goodness-of-fit test,
      implemented for testing multivariate normality with
      estimated parameters

    * eqdist.etest (test) and ksample.e (statistic)
      A k-sample multivariate nonparametric test of equal distributions
      (arbitrary number of samples and arbitrary dimension)
      with optional incomplete statistics to support testing
      arbitrarily large samples

    * energy.hclust and edist
      Hierarchical clustering based on e-distances and
      cluster distance function

    * poisson.mtest (test) and poisson.m (statistic)
      Mean distance test of Poisson distribution, estimated mean

Here is a brief summary of the potential energy background of the
tests in the energy package:

Newton's gravitational force is inversely proportional to squared
Euclidean distances between pairs of objects, and the potential
energy is inversely proportional to their Euclidean distances. The
simplest choice for the absolute value of the force is constant, and
then the potential energy is proportional to the Euclidean distances
between pairs of objects. In statistics, the objects are the observed
random vectors, and thus our energy terms are Euclidean distances
between the pairs of sample elements: ||x_i - x_j||. Tests are based
on the Theorem that a suitable linear combination of these distances
(the potential energy of the 'statistical situation') is always
nonnegative, and equals 0 if and only if the null hypothesis holds.

Comments and suggestions are welcome. The description file is below.

gregmisc 0.10.1
---------------

gregmisc 0.10.1 is now available at ftp://cran.r-project.org/incoming/ and
will move to the regular contributed packages location
(http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES.html#gregmisc) as soon as
the CRAN administrators get caught up.

Recent Changes
---------------

Version 0.10.1

- Fixed bug in textplot() reported by Kevin Wright  <kevin.d.wright at
pioneer
  dot com>.

Version 0.10.0

- Now works with and requires R 1.9.0

- Added ooplot() function that mimics Open-Office style plots.
  Contributed by Lodewijk Bonebakker <bonebakker at comcast.net>

- Fixed bug in running() that arose when the called function
  really needed a minimum number of elements to work on.

- Added several new features to running(), it can now allow sequences
  shorter than the requested width to be present at the front, the back,
  or on both sides of the full lenth sequences.  This allows one to
  align the data so that the window is before, after, or around the
  indexed point.

- Add enhancements to estimable() provided by S?ren H?jsgaard
  <sorenh at agrsci.dk>:

  The estimable function now
  1) also works on geese and gee objects and
  2) can test hypotheses af the forb L * beta = beta0 both as a
     single Wald test and row-wise for each row in L.

- Add colorpanel function, which generates a smoothly varying band of
  colors over a three color range (lo, mid, high).

Hi to all R users,

I have just uploaded in CRAN R2HTML 1.3, latest update of the R2HTML 
package, so that it should soon be available for your favorite platform.


CHANGELOG:
- Fixed some user-contributed bugs.
- More CSS styles are defined, so that it's possible to change the whole 
look-and-feel of outputs / Add some CSS sample files.
- Added HTMLstem to produce a stem-and-leaf plot (as stem does directly 
print to console).
- Added HTML.cormat, which is not a real S3 method but allows to write 
correlation matrices with "traffic highlighting" (colours).
- Added a Sweave driver (for Friedrich Leisch wonderfull Sweave tool) which 
allows to include R code within complex HTML files and to replace this code 
by it's outputs (objects in HTML and graphs in png). Comes with sample files.
- Dynamic use with HTMLStart() has a new option 'autobrowse' which 
auto-refresh (callls) the browser each time a command is processed.

Description: Includes HTML function and methods to write in an HTML file. 
Thus, making HTML reports is easy. Includes a fonction that allows 
redirection on the fly, which appears to be very usefull for teaching 
purpose, as the student can keep a copy of the produced output to keep all 
that he did during the course. Package comes with a vignette describing how 
to write HTML reports for statistical analysis. Finally, a driver for 
Sweave allows to parse HTML flat files containing R code and to 
automatically write the corresponding outputs (tables and graphs).

Hi,

this is to announce a new version (1.1-2) of my package fpc. Apart from
the stuff already present in the older version (methods for fixed point
clustering and clusterwise regression, somewhat bug-cleaned and with
faster examples) there is now a function cluster.stats, which computes
some distance-based statistics often used for cluster validation,
description and decision about the number of clusters, including the
so-called corrected rand index and some further methods mentioned in the
Gordon 1999 book on Classification.

Best,
Christian

We would like to announce the availability on CRAN of a new package distr .
It is to provide a conceptual treatment of random variables (r.v.'s) by 
means of
S4--classes. A virtual mother class "Distribution" is introduced.
All distributions of the "base" package are implemented as subclasses of
either "AbscontDistribution" or "DiscreteDistribution".

Using these classes, we also provide (default) methods to automatically
generate the image distributions under unary mathematical operations as
well as a general convolution algorithm.

Additionally, we also provide classes for a standardized treatment of
simulations (also under contaminations) and evaluations of statistical
procedures on such simulations.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Release candidate 1 of lme4_0.6-1
Message-ID: <6roepcq87v.fsf@bates4.stat.wisc.edu>

Deepayan Sarkar and I have a source package of release candidate 1 of
the 0.6 series of the lme4 package available at
         http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~bates/lme4_0.6-0-1.tar.gz
This package requires Matrix_0.8-6 which has been uploaded to CRAN and
should be available in a few days.  A copy of the source package is
available as
         http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~bates/Matrix_0.8-6.tar.gz

Although this version of lme4 passes "R CMD check" on our GNU/Linux
systems we have not uploaded it to CRAN because it still lacks
capabilities that are available in lme4_0.5-2, which is currently on
CRAN.  As soon as we have all the capabilities of the 0.5 series
available in the 0.6 series we will release lme4_0.6-1.tar.gz to CRAN.

This version of lme4 is a complete rewrite of the data structures and
algorithms for fitting linear mixed models.  An incomplete draft
version of a paper describing the methods is available as a vignette.
Subsequent releases will contain a more polished version of this
paper.

The big change relative to earlier versions is that you can fit models
with crossed random effects quickly and easily.  For example, using
the data on Scottish secondary school students achievement scores
(from http://multilevel.ioe.ac.uk/softrev/) we can fit a model with
random effects for both the secondary and the primary school attended
as

There are other examples in the tests subdirectory.  

The lme function behaves as previously *with one exception*.  In the
model specification there is no longer any distinction between crossed
or nested or partially crossed random effects.  This means that for
nested random effects you must ensure that every inner grouping
corresponds to a unique level of the inner grouping factor.  For
example, in the Pixel data there are two grouping factors, Dog and
Side with Side nested within Dog.  You must create a new grouping
factor, say DS, with unique levels for each Dog/Side combination to be
able to specify a model of "Side within Dog".

Subject: [R-pkgs] lme4_0.6-1 uploaded
Message-ID: <6rbrk36kjo.fsf@bates4.stat.wisc.edu>

I have uploaded release 0.6-1 of the lme4 package to the incoming area
on CRAN.  I expect it will be transferred to the archive within a
couple of days, after which Uwe's Windows build daemon should be able
to get it to build a Windows version.  The lme4 package itself is a
pure R package (i.e. it does not contain any code to be compiled) but
it depends on the Matrix_0.8-7 package which has a considerable amount
of C code in it.

This package contains the version of lme that I spoke of at useR!2004.
Using sparse matrix methods - in particular, Tim Davis' LDL package -
we are able to fit models with crossed random effects quickly and
effectively.  This package also contains an implementation of GLMM for
Generalized Linear Mixed Models using either Penalized
Quasi-Likelihood (PQL) or ML estimation using the Laplacian
approximation to the marginal likelihood.  At present method =
'Laplace' is considerably slower than method = 'PQL'.  We would
recommend using PQL for model building and determining final parameter
estimates using method = 'Laplace'.

Feedback is welcome.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New versions of Hmisc and Design on CRAN
Message-ID: <40C0735F.8050204@vanderbilt.edu>

New versions of source packages for Hmisc and Design are available from 
CRAN for R 1.9 on Linux/Unix.   Knowing Uwe Ligges, a Windows binary is 
not far behind.  Changelogs are at 
http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/ChangelogHmisc and
http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/ChangelogDesign . 
These versions pass R CMD check for the latest R-devel so I expect they 
will work on the next production release of R.

Of special note is the Hmisc sasxport.get function's new method='csv' 
argument.  This works with a SAS macro to use SAS PROC EXPORT to export 
an entire data library, and handles variable and value labels, date, 
time, data/time variables [for dates, the new R Date class is now used 
as is also now used for sas.get, spss.get, csv.get].  We have found the 
new SAS import method in sasxport.get to be the most reliable way to 
convert datasets from SAS if you can run SAS on your system or on a 
server.  An example may be found at 
http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/SASexportHowto and 
the SAS macro is at 
http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/pub/Main/Hmisc/exportlib.sas .

Subject: [R-pkgs] gregmisc 1.11.2 including read.xls()
Message-ID: <D7A3CFD7825BD6119B880002A58F06C20C52150A@groexmb02.pfizer.com>


Release 1.11.2 of the gregmisc() package of functions is now available on
CRAN at http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/gregmisc.html for
both Unix and Windows systems.

The most notable enhancement provided by this release is:

- read.xls(), a function to read Microsoft Excel files by
  translating them to csv files via the xls2csv.pl script has
  been added.  I've also provided Unix and MS-Windows scripts 
  in <R_LIBRARY_DIR>/gregmisc/bin which allow you to call 
  xls2csv directly.  The code uses perl libraries which are
  included in the package, so perl must be in the execution path.

Other enhancements include:

- Improvements to CrossTable() by Marc Schwartz <MSchwartz at MedAnalytics.com>

- Improvements to ooplot() by Lodewijk Bonebakker <bonebakker at comcast.net>

- plotCI() and plotmeans() now have improved argument handling.

- The running() function now has an additional parameter `simplify'
  which controls whether the returned values are simplified into a
  vector/matrix or left as a list.

- A makefile that will download and attempt to install all available
  packages from CRAN and Bioconductor is now provided in
  $PACKAGE$/gregmisc/tools/

- space() can now space points along the 'y' dimension.

- Fix an error in the permutations code for repeats.allow=T and r>2.
  Both the bug report and fix are from Elizabeth Purdom
  <epurdom at stanford.edu>.

- Various fixes for compatibility with R 1.9.X.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package: RUnit
Message-ID: <40C9B6C6.1020604@epigenomics.com>

We would like to announce the availability on CRAN of a new package: RUnit

It contains a unit testing framework strongly inspired by Javas popular 
JUint package. In addition it contains some functionality to investigate 
the degree to which some function is covered by a test suite.

The main aims of the package are
- to support a development style where test cases are written and 
constantly executed parallel to implementing the actual functinality.
- to deliver the results of a test run in a format as structured and 
helpful as possible.

Besides the usual function documentation the doc subdirectory contains a 
pdf file with additional information.


Questions, comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Happy testing

Subject: [R-pkgs] gstat 0.9-12: cokriging cross validation and class name
	incompatibilities
Message-ID: <40CFFB52.4040102@geog.uu.nl>

I uploaded gstat 0.9-12 to CRAN, which has a few important changes:

1. Cokriging cross validation

Cokriging cross validation is now possible with the function gstat.cv:
you simply pass a multivariable gstat object, and cross validation is done
for the first variable in the object. Optionally, secondary variable 
records
at locations coinciding with the validation locations are removed.

2. Class name changes

Both gstat and geoR used the name "variogram" for -- highly incompatible --
objects that contain information about a variogram. This led to errors when
calling plot() with a variogram object calculated from one, but plotted by
the other package. I changed the class name into "gstatVariogram". The full
list of class name changes:

variogram -> gstatVariogram
point.pairs -> pointPairs
variogram.map -> variogramMap
variogram.cloud -> variogramCloud

You can still run scripts you have with the new packages, but e.g. plot(v)
when v is an old object of class "variogram" will not work with the new
package. As these are S3 classes, a simple solution would be to
reassign the class:

class(v) = c("gstatVariogram", "data.frame")

3. Compatibility with package sp and variogram maps
On http://sourceforge.net/projects/r-spatial/ beta releases for the upcoming
package sp are available; sp provides classes and methods for spatial data.
Instead of:

 > library(gstat)
 > data(meuse)
 > variogram(zinc~1, ~x+y, meuse)

you could, with package sp loaded, do:

 > coordinates(meuse) = ~x+y # promotes meuse to SpatialDataFrame
 > variogram(zinc~1, meuse) # no coordinates required.

In addition, sp provides classes for gridded data and polygon data. With sp
loaded, gstat can calculate variogram maps.

Any comments are welcome,

Message-ID: <40D85970.8090506@univie.ac.at>

Today we uploaded a new release of the
R (D)COM server for Windows to CRAN.
It is release 1.35

The software is much more stable, and there are
quite a few improvements.

Excerpts from the NEWS file:

RServerManager has been added. This provides a repository for R COM 
servers.  See the samples and the additional documentation

Partial rewrite of the code for SetSymbol() and GetSymbol().
Now arrays of VARIANTs are supported to some degree.
This makes the COM server accessible to many scripting languages

Sample usage for JScript, Python, and VBScript added

New tools library provided for Excel to remotely access COM server
without the need for local installation

The software should appear on CRAN in the "Other" section
within the next few days.

MNP: R Package for Fitting the Multinomial Probit Models

Abstract:
MNP is a publicly available R package that fits the Bayesian multinomial
probit models via Markov chain Monte Carlo. Along with the standard
multinomial probit model, it can also fit models with different choice
sets for each observation, and complete or partial ordering of all the
available alternatives. The computation is based on the efficient marginal
data augmentation algorithm that is developed by Imai and van Dyk (2004)  
``A Bayesian Analysis of the Multinomial Probit Model Using the Data
Augmentation,'' Journal of Econometrics, Forthcoming.

Subject: [R-pkgs] randomForest 4.3-0 released
Message-ID: <3A822319EB35174CA3714066D590DCD504AF7FF4@usrymx25.merck.com>

Dear all,

Version 4.3-0 of the randomForest package is now available on CRAN (in
source; binaries will follow in due course).  There are some interface
changes and a few new features, as well as bug fixes.  For those who had
used previous versions, the important things to note are: 1. there's a
namespace now, and 2. some functions have been renamed.  The list of changes
since 4.0-7 (last public release) is shown below.

As many changes were made to the package, it's very likely that new bugs
have crept in.  I'd very much appreciate bug reports or even patches!

The plan is still to add features to the package so that it matches the
features in Breiman and Cutler's latest Fortran version.  There is also plan
to add some functions so that the package will work with Adele Cutler's Java
visualization program (RAFT).

Best,
Andy

====================================================
Changes in 4.3-0:

* Thanks to Adele Cutler, there's now casewise variable importance 
  measures in classification.  Similar feature is also added for 
  regression.  Use the new localImp option in randomForest().

* The `importance' component of randomForest object has been changed:  
  The permutation-based measures are not divided by their `standard 
  errors'.  Instead, the `standard errors' are stored in the 
  `importanceSD' component.  One should use the importance() extractor 
  function rather than something like rf.obj$importance for extracting 
  the importance measures.

* The importance() extractor function has been updated:  If the 
  permutation-based measures are available, calling importance() 
  with only a randomForest object returns the matrix of variable 
  importance measures.  There is the `scale' argument, which defaults 
  to TRUE.

* In predict.randomForest, there is a new argument `nodes' (default to 
  FALSE).  For classification, if nodes=TRUE, the returned object has an
  attribute `nodes', which is an n by ntree matrix of terminal node
  indicators.  This is ignored for regression.

Changes in 4.2-1:

* There is now a package name space.  Only generics are exported.

* Some function names have been changed: 
    partial.plot -> partialPlot
    var.imp.plot -> varImpPlot
    var.used     -> varUsed

* There is a new option `replace' in randomForest() (default to TRUE)
  indicating whether the sampling of cases is with or without
  replacement. 

* In randomForest(), the `sampsize' option now works for both
  classification and regression, and indicate the number of cases to be 
  drawn to grow each tree.  For classification, if sampsize is a vector of
  length the number of classes, then sampling is stratified by class.

* With the formula interface for randomForest(), the default na.action,	
  na.fail, is effective.  I.e., an error is given if there are NAs present
  in the data.  If na.omit is desired, it must be given explicitly.

* For classification, the err.rate component of the randomForest object
  (and the corresponding one for test set) now is a ntree by (nclass + 1)
  matrix, the first column of which contains the overall error rate, and
  the remaining columns the class error rates.  The running output now
  also prints class error rates.  The plot method for randomForest will
  plot the class error rates as well.

* The predict() method now checks whether the variable names in newdata 
  match those from the training data (if the randomForest object is not
  created from the formula interface).

* partialPlot() and varImpPlot() now have optional arguments xlab, ylab
  and main for more flexible labelling.  Also, if a factor is given as
  the variable, a real bar plot is produced.

* partialPlot() will now remove rows with NAs from the data frame given.

* For regression, if proximity=FALSE, an n by n array of integers is 
  erroneously allocated but not used (it's only used for proximity 
  calculation, so not needed otherwise).

* Updated combine() to conform to the new randomForest object.

* na.roughfix() was not working correctly for matrices, which in turns 
  causes problem in rfImpute().

 
Changes in 4.1-0:

* In randomForest(), if sampsize is given, the sampling is now done
  without replacement, in addition to stratified by class.  Therefore 
  sampsize can not be larger than the class frequencies.

* In classification randomForest, checks are added to avoid trees with 
  only the root node.

* Fixed a bug in the Fortran code for classification that caused segfault 
  on some system when encountering a tree with only root node.

* The help page for predict.randomForest() now states the fact that when 
  newdata is not specified, the OOB predictions from the randomForest 
  object is returned.

* plot.randomForest() and print.randomForest() were not checking for 
  existence of performance (err.rate or mse) on test data correctly.

Message-ID: <40FDE625.3030506@jhsph.edu>

We would like to announce release of version 0.3-3 of the 
NMMAPSdata package.  NMMAPSdata is an R package which contains 
time series data on air pollution, weather, and mortality for 108 
United States cities for the years 1987--2000.  These data were 
originally assembled for the National Morbidity, Mortality, and 
Air Pollution Study sponsored by the Health Effects Institute and 
have since been updated.  While the data have been publicly 
available for some time now, NMMAPSdata, in addition to being a 
convenience for R users, assembles all of the city data into one 
package and contains some utility functions for managing the 
database.

NMMAPSdata can be downloaded from

http://www.ihapss.jhsph.edu/data/NMMAPS/R/

The package comes with a vignette which contains an overview of 
the data and a few example analyses.

Comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Message-ID: <1091440669.410e101d6cd9a@www.cx.unibe.ch>

Dear all,

I would like to announce the availability of a new package on CRAN:

RNetCDF: R Interface to NetCDF Datasets

This package provides an interface to Unidata's NetCDF library functions 
(version 3) and furthermore access to Unidata's udunits calendar
conversions. The routines and the documentation follow the NetCDF and
udunits C interface, so the corresponding manuals can be consulted for
more detailed information.

The main aims of this package are:
- to provide full read/write access to all NetCDF datasets (supporting
  all external NetCDF data types)
- to provide a low level interface which allows the user to write his
  own (customized) NetCDF read/write functions in a simple way

This package requires Unidata's NetCDF and the undunits library already 
installed on the system, which are both available from Unidata's website
(http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/).


Feedback is greatly appreciated.

Pavel


I would like to thank Juerg Schmidli for his excellent comments and
suggestions during the development process of this package and This
Rutishauser for testing the package from the user's perspective.

Subject: [R-pkgs] gam --- a new contributed package
Message-ID: <030f01c47bdb$c8d6a160$ec6640ab@stuk>

I have contributed a "gam" library to CRAN,
which implements "Generalized Additive Models".

This implementation follows closely the description in 
the GAM chapter 7 of the "white" book "Statistical Models in S"
(Chambers & Hastie (eds), 1992, Wadsworth), as well as the philosophy
in "Generalized Additive Models" (Hastie & Tibshirani 1990, Chapman and
Hall). Hence it behaves pretty much like the Splus version of GAM.

Note: this gam library and functions therein are different from the
gam function in package mgcv, and both libraries should not be used
simultaneously.

The gam library allows both local regression (loess) and smoothing
spline smoothers, and uses backfitting and local scoring to fit gams.
It also allows users to supply their own smoothing methods which can
then be included in gam fits.

The gam function in mgcv uses only smoothing spline smoothers, with a
focus on automatic parameter selection via gcv. 

Some of the features of the gam library:

* full compatibility with the R functions glm and lm - a fitted gam
  inherits from class "glm" and "lm"

* print, summary, anova, predict and plot methods are provided, as
  well as the usual extractor methods like coefficients, residuals etc

* the method step.gam provides a flexible and customizable approach to
  model selection. 

Some differences with the Splus version of gam:

* predictions with new data are improved, without need for the
  "safe.predict.gam" function. This was partly facilitated by
  the improved prediction strategy used in R for GLMs and LMs

* Currently the only backfitting algorithm is all.wam. In the earlier
  versions of gam, dedicated fortran routines fit models that had only
  smoothing spline terms (s.wam) or all local regression terms
  (lo.wam), which in fact made calls back to Splus to update the
  working response and weights. These were designed for efficiency. It
  seems now with much faster computers this efficiency is no longer
  needed, and all.wam is modular and "visible"

 
This package is numbered 0.9 in anticipation of a few bug fixes and
glitches. I have tested many aspects of the functions, but there are
always a few that slip by. I will be happy to hear of any problems,
bugs and suggestions.

Plans for future versions:

* exact standard error calculations. gam employs approximations as
  described in the white book. With a bit more computing (now
  possible), we will have a function that computes exact standard
  errors along the lines described in the GAM book page 127.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0408111452280.15406-100000@zil.kom.auc.dk>

I have recently uploaded a new package to CRAN called eba,
which stands for elimination-by-aspects models.

It allows for fitting and testing probabilistic choice models,
especially the BTL model (Bradley & Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959),
elimination-by-aspects (EBA) models (Tversky, 1972), and
preference tree (Pretree) models (Tversky & Sattath, 1979).

I believe that the functions in this package can be useful
in many fields, like marketing, consumer research, psychological
scaling, and food testing, to name only a few.

Detailed information about probabilistic choice models and
how to fit them can be found in a recent publication:

Wickelmaier, F. & Schmid, C. (2004). A Matlab function to estimate
  choice model parameters from paired-comparison data. Behavior
  Research Methods, Instruments, and Computers, 36(1), 29-40.

I would be glad to receive some feedback or comments.

Message-ID: <20040812200147.3e098447.Achim.Zeileis@wu-wien.ac.at>

Dear useRs,

I used the summer months to work on all of my packages,
and so this is the first of a sequence of announcements
of "new" or updated packages. The "new" packages are new 
in the sense that previous versions had been on CRAN for
some months but hadn't been announced to the R community
via this list until now.

All packages are available from the CRAN master site
in source form - binary versions should be available
from the mirrors in the next days.


So the first announcement is for fortunes 1.0-3:

The fortunes package provides simple infrastructure for
reading fortunes from a .csv file and displaying them.
Furthermore, it contains a growing list of fortunes
related to R, mainly collected from the mailing lists
but also from quotes at conferences. The author list
contains me (as I've written the R code) as well as
the people who contributed quotes by sending me a mail.
The original "authors" of each quote are always given
in the respective fortune.

For those of you who want to see a quote each time they 
start up R: you can add to your .Rprofile something like

if(interactive()) { library(fortunes); fortune() }

If you want to create your own list of fortunes you can
simply add another fortune collection in .csv format.
Of course, it would also be great if you could contribute
some quotes to the package...simply send me an e-mail.

Enjoy!

Message-ID: <20040812200328.0c22c1d6.Achim.Zeileis@wu-wien.ac.at>

Dear useRs,

here is the announcement for the next "new" package:
sandwich 0.1-3.

sandwich provides heteroskedasticity (and autocorrelation)
consistent covariance matrix estimators (also called HC
and HAC estimators).

The former are implemented in the function vcovHC() (which
was available in strucchange  before - and independently
in hccm() in John Fox's car package).

And the latter are implemented in the function vcovHAC().
This implements sandwich-type estimators in a rather 
flexible way, allowing for user-defined weights or 
weight functions. It builds on some of the functionality
which was before available in Thomas Lumley's weave package
(not on CRAN). In particular it makes available the
class of WEAVE estimators introduced by Lumley & Heagerty (1999)
in the function weave() which is a convenience interface to
vcovHAC(). Furthermore, it implements the class of kernel
HAC estimators with automatic bandwidth-selection of
Andrews (1991) in the function kernHAC(), which is again a
convenience interface to vcovHAC().

Best wishes,
Z

Dear useRs,

yet another "new" package: zoo 0.2-0.

zoo provides a simple S3 class and methods for totally
ordered indexed observations such as irregular time
series. Although there are other packages for irregular
time series available on CRAN (Giles Heywood's its 
package and irts() in Adrian Trapletti's tseries package)
I wrote this package because I needed something which
provides simple infrastructure for observations with
(almost) arbitrary indexes (and not only "POSIXct" time
stampes as in its() and irts()). And it was at least also
useful for Gabor Grothendieck who provided most of the
updates to this version.

Best wishes,

Subject: [R-pkgs] updated package strucchange 1.2-4
Message-ID: <20040812200506.78e22588.Achim.Zeileis@wu-wien.ac.at>

Dear useRs,

the strucchange package for testing for structural change
has been updated: the current version is 1.2-4.
The most significant additions were two functions gefp()
and efpFunctional().

gefp() implements a class of generalized M-fluctuation
tests for testing for parameter instability or structural
change in general parametric models including generalized
linear models (GLMs). 

efpFunctional() provides infrastructure for inference based
on functionals applied to empirical fluctuation processes
such as automatic tabulation of critical values and a choice
of a suitable visualization method.

The theory behind both functions is described in Zeileis
& Hornik (2003), the implementation ideas are explained in
Zeileis (2004). Links to both papers are available from
my web page: http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~zeileis/

Best wishes,
Z

Description: Testing, dating and monitoring of structural change in
             linear regression relationships.
             strucchange features tests/methods from the generalized
             fluctuation test framework as well as from the F test (Chow
             test) framework. This includes methods to fit, plot and
             test fluctuation processes (e.g., CUSUM, MOSUM,
             recursive/moving estimates) and F statistics, respectively.
             It is possible to monitor incoming data online using
             fluctuation processes.
             Finally, the breakpoints in regression models with
             structural changes can be estimated together with
             confidence intervals. Emphasis is always given to methods
             for visualizing the data.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0409151632150.17035-100000@gannet.stats>

The first non-maintenance update of RODBC since January 2003 is now on 
CRAN and will soon propagate to mirrors.  From the ChangeLog:

        * Select the decimal point from Sys.localeconv.

        * Add an external reference and finalizer so open channels get
          closed at the end of the session or when there is no R object
          referring to them.

        * There is no longer a restriction to 16 channels.

        * Add NAMESPACE.

        * odbcConnect{Access,Dbase,Excel} allow a missing file name
          (and will bring up a dialog box to search for it).

        * odbcGetInfo returns more information in a 8-element character
          vector (based on an idea of Matthew Dowle).

        * The C code calls SQLExecuteDirect rather than SQLExecute and
          does not call SQLCloseCursor, based on a problem report from
          Matthew Dowle using MS SQLServer.  Repeated calls to
          sqlGetResults now work.

        * New function sqlFetchMore.

        * Table names in Access with embedded spaces are mapped to the
          [name space] form which Access requires.

        * Table creation no longer removes _ from column names.

        * New functions get/setSqlTypeInfo and the typeInfo argument to
          sqlSave allow users to specify the mapping from R types to DBMS
          datatypes.  sqlSave also allows the specification of DBMS
          datatypes by column.

        * It is now possible to write more than 255 chars to a field with
          sqlSave and sqlUpdate.

        * Dates and timestamps are now read as 'Date' and 'POSIXct'
          columns by sqlGetResults (unless as.is = TRUE for the column).

I have been able to test SQL Server reasonably extensively this time 
around, as well as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Access, Excel and SQLite.

Parallel programming with snowFT

Our package snowFT is now available at CRAN. It is an extention of the
package snow, which adds fault tolerance (in the sense of recomputing
computational units when hardware/network failures occur on compute
nodes) and a tighter notion of reproducibility for computations
running on clusters.  It additionally provides tools for flexible
management of cluster size as well as computation transparency.

snowFT is written by Hana Sevcikova and Tony Rossini.

(this tool currently requires rpvm for the SNOW backend, though we are
exploring the possibility of extensions for the Rmpi backend.  It is
unlikely that these extensions will be implemented for the socket
backend.

	Announcing Rpad, a web-based workbook-style interface for R
Message-ID: <414B35AC.1030201@epri-peac.com>


Rpad is an interactive, web-based analysis system. Rpad pages are
interactive workbook-type sheets based on R. Rpad is an analysis package, a
web-page designer, and a gui designer all wrapped in one. Rpad pages are 
run from the browser and connect to R running on the server (the same 
server that hosts the web pages).

Rpad includes the R package "RpadUtils", which adds convenient code to
generate HTML widgets and convenience functions for generating web graphics
(png).

For more information and demonstrations, please see:

http://www.Rpad.org/Rpad/

Key features include:

(*) WYSIWYG editing -- The browser page is editable, so you can add 
comments or change the code or input data.

(*) GUI's -- Create GUI elements with R or with the Rpad interface.

(*) Fast -- No browser refreshes. The R process on the server stays alive 
while the browser page is open, so once the page is up and running, it is 
quite responsive.

(*) HTML output -- Create fancy HTML output using Eric Lecoutre's R2HTML.

(*) Simple plotting -- Has convenience functions to simplify creation and
presentation of web-friendly graphics.

(*) Flexible -- You can add features in a number of ways with javascript
and/or R.

(*) Cross platform -- Rpad pages work in Internet Explorer v5.5 or greater
and Mozilla (Firefox or Suite). The server-side code works in Apache in
Linux or Windows (although not as well in Windows).

(*) Open source -- Rpad brings together several powerful open-source
technologies, specifically: R, Mozile, HTMLArea, Statistics-R-0.02,
JSCookMenu, Apache, and R2HTML.

Feel free to use the r-sig-gui mailing list
(https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-gui) for any feedback on Rpad, 
the demonstration pages, and especially for feedback and questions on
installing your own Rpad server.

Dear all,

I have just uploaded a package to CRAN a new package called 'adehabitat'.
This package is intended for ecologists who want to analyse the use of 
space by animals.
Many functions currently used in this field are available to
highlight habitat selection by animals (selection ratios, ENFA, habitat 
suitability maps
with the algorithm DOMAIN or Resource Selection Functions)
or to describe the movements and area used in radio-tracking studies 
(kernel or
minimum convex polygon home range, computation of travel speed and turning 
angles).
ASCII raster maps exported from Arcview can also be imported, and basic GIS 
operations
are available (e.g. spatial join, computation of buffers).

The package comes with a pdf documentation file which
contains an overview of the main classes of maps available
in the package.

Questions, comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Here is the description file of the package:

Subject: [R-pkgs] new version of package "distr" available
Message-ID: <41586016.7060705@uni-bayreuth.de>

We would like to announce the availability on CRAN of a new version (1.4)
of our package "distr" .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from 1.3 to 1.4
-To avoid name collisions with short forms for TRUE and FALSE: classes T
 and F (T- and F-distributions) renamed to Td and Fd
-The package is now loaded as a binary => considerable speed gain
-Using subsititute, the bodies of the r,d,p,q-function-slots
 distributions show the parameter values with which they were 
 generated
-Convolutions and applications of the math group may now be traced in
 r-slot of a distribution object, compare
              r(sin(Norm()) + cos(Unif() * 3 + 2))
-Parameters of a distribution (mean, sd, etc) are now tested on length 1
  *we see the objects as implementations of univariate distributions, so
   vectors  make  no sense here; rather one could gather several objects 
   with possibly different parameters to a vector of distributions.
   Of course, the original R-functions rnorm etc remain unchanged and
   still allow for vector-valued parameters.
  *
-Classes "Parameter" , "Distribution" , "UnivariateDistribution" are no
 longer VIRTUAL
-"AbscontParameter" and "DiscreteParameter" are replaced by "Parameter"
-Type of slots d,p,q  and param is changed to "OptionalFunction" and
 "OptionalParameter" respectively

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Description of "distr":
"distr" is to provide a conceptual treatment of random variables
(r.v.'s) by means of S4--classes. A virtual mother class "Distribution" 
is introduced.
All distributions of the "base" package are implemented as subclasses of
either "AbscontDistribution" or "DiscreteDistribution".

Using these classes, we also provide (default) methods to automatically
generate the image distributions under unary mathematical operations as
well as a general convolution algorithm.

Additionally, we also provide classes for a standardized treatment of
simulations (also under contaminations) and evaluations of statistical
procedures on such simulations.

gregmisc 2.0.0
===========

gregmisc 2.0.0 has been released and is now available on CRAN.   

Important Changes
---------------------------

- Now a package bundle 

For this release, gregmisc has been split into a bundle containing 4
separate packages: gdata, gmodels, gplots and gtools. All of your favorite
functions are still present, but they are now better organized into thematic
groups, which should make them easier to maintain.

- Namespaces

Each of the gregmisc packages now provide namespaces, and are fully
compatible with R 2.0.0.   The namespaces make it easier to avoid conflicts
with functions in other packages, and prevent local utility functions from
cluttering up the global function namespace.

Consequences for Users
------------------------------------

Instead of attaching the gregmisc package, you will need to attach the
appropriate individual packages.  IE, instead of
	> library(gregmisc)
you should use one or more of
	> library(gdata)
	> library(gmodels)
	> library(gplots)
	> library(gtools)

For more details, including bug fixes, see the ChangeLog file in the source
distribution.

Subject: [R-pkgs] updated package boolean 1.5
Message-ID: <FBBB9805-18C2-11D9-A4F9-000A95A672D6@fas.harvard.edu>


I have just uploaded an updated version of my boolean package (v1.05), 
which should be propagating through CRAN's mirrors soon.  Boolean 
permits estimation of Boolean logit and probit models (see Braumoeller 
(2003), full reference in help file, for derivation).  Boolean logit 
and probit are a family of partial-observability n-variate models 
designed to permit researchers to model causal complexity, or multiple 
causal "paths" to a given outcome.  The various "paths" are modeled as 
latent dependent variables that are multiplied together in a manner 
determined by the logic of their (Boolean) interaction.  Any 
combination of ANDs and ORs can be posited, and the interaction of any 
number of latent dependent variables can be modeled, although the 
procedure becomes exponentially more data-intensive as the number of 
latent dependent variables increases.

The update to version 1.04 was not announced; only minor modifications 
were made to ensure compatibility with R 1.9.

The update to version 1.05 permits the use of Sekhon and Mebane's 
GENOUD optimizer for likelihood surfaces that are convoluted and 
therefore contain multiple local maxima.  Because this procedure can 
produce such surfaces quite easily, the use of GENOUD is recommended.

Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The package includes one R function, which
passes  all  the necessary control parameters to the appropriate Fortran
functions.

The package location is
http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/minpack.lm.html


Best wishes,
Timur.

Message-ID: <6.0.1.1.2.20041019162257.034c6ec0@stat4ux.stat.ucl.ac.be>


Hi useRs,

I have uploaded on CRAN R2HTML version 1.4-3, which should be available 
soon for your favorite platform.

For R 2.0.0, I had to rewrite some parts of the code so that it works. I 
did that quickly (maybe too), letting some bugs.

Now, this is mere the good R 2.0 version, with some new functionalities:

- HTML.matrix and HTML.data.frame now can use several new output options
   as they call now 'format. This allows using a comma "," as decimal
   separator for example. All 'format' arguments are allowed and can be used
   as a single element (value applies to all columns) or a vector (provide
   values for each column). - Suggestion by Arne Henningsen

- HTML.data.frame now has a sortableDF option. When using it, a link to
   an external DHTML behavior file is done (suggestion by Tom Short, could be
   used by it's wonderful Rpad)

- Available options that user may want to change
  (default for every   matrix/DF):
	R2HTML.sortableDF  		(FALSE)
	R2HTML.format.digits  		(2)
	R2HTML.format.nsmall  		(0)
	R2HTML.format.big.mark		("")
	R2HTML.format.big.interval	(3)
	R2HTML.format.decimal.mark=	(Sys.localeconv()[["decimal_point"]])

- Bug fixed: HTML.table

Following modifications contributed by Philippe Grosjean

- Now uses NAMESPACE

- Renamed .First.lib() into .onLoad()

- In RweaveHTMLSetup(), commented if(!require(R2HTML))
       stop("R2HTML package is required.").
   This is not useful, becasue this function IS in R2HTML package!!!

- Changed utils:::XXX and utils::XXX into XXX everywhere, and added
   import(utils) in NAMESPACE instead.

Dear useRs,

FlexMix version 1.0-0 has been released on CRAN. FlexMix implements a
general framework for finite mixtures of regression models using the
EM algorithm.  FlexMix provides the E-step and all data handling,
while the M-step can be supplied by the user to easily define new
models. Existing drivers implement mixtures of standard linear models,
generalized linear models and model-based clustering.

Compared to the porvious version on CRAN the code has not changed, but
the package has now an introductionary vignette, see

	vignette("flexmix-intro")

after installing the package. The vignette has also been published in
the Journal of Statistical Software, see http://www.jstatsoft.org.

Message-ID: <16761.17686.677020.587408@ls01.fas.harvard.edu>


"Matching" version 0.48 is now available on CRAN.

Matching provides functions for estimating causal effects by
multivariate and propensity score matching. The package includes a
variety of univariate and multivariate tests to determine if balance
has been obtained by the matching procedure. These tests can also be
used to determine if an experiment or quasi-experiment is balanced on
baseline covariates.  The functions provide valid standard errors and
allow one to estimate various estimands.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0410281558340.3752-100000@gannet.stats>

There is an update for the `foreign' package now on the CRAN master and 
soon on a mirror near you.

This adds support for

DBF files (by Nicholas Lewin-Koh, Roger Bivand and myself)
Systat files written on MS-DOS/Windows (by Roger Bivand)

The reasons for announcing this update are

1) People quite often ask for DBF support.

2) There is a `maptools' update that depends on getting this one.

3) We have tested many Systat and DBF files, and even created some extreme
examples of our own.  But many applications write DBF files and inevitably
there are rogue files out there, so we would appreciate seeing examples
that either do not work as expected or crash R.

The `R Data Import/Export' manual in R-patched and R-devel has been 
revised to cover the new functionality.

This is an update (version 1.2), not a new package, but given recent 
postings on the R lists an announcement may be helpful.

The 'dichromat' package has color schemes designed for people with 
red-green deficient or anomalous vision, tools for simulating the effect 
of color blindness, and tools for creating color ramps and palettes (these 
last will be in R 2.1.0).

I would welcome feedback on the accuracy of the simulations of color 
blindness from people who are actually affected. They are based on 
published algorithms and methods, but color matching is always tricky.

Message-ID: <a06200710bdc39dd2eba3@[139.166.242.29]>

Dear list

R package "gsl" is now on  CRAN.  This  is a wrapper for
the special functions of the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL).  Functions include
elliptic integrals, Airy functions, hypergeometric functions, and so on.
Most functions optionally return error estimates.

This library is a little odd in that documentation is limited to a 
pointer to the GSL reference
manual, and occasional re-productions of tables and figures from 
Abramowitz and Stegun.

It passes R CMD check  under Fedora Linux, and MacOSX 10.3 if the GSL
(version 1.5)  is installed in the default locations.

A windows version is available at  http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/RWin/2.0.0/

Subject: [R-pkgs] New Hmisc Package Available
Message-ID: <41ACF14A.5030803@vanderbilt.edu>

An updated version of Hmisc is now available from CRAN.  The Web site 
for Hmisc is http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/s/Hmisc.  The change log 
may be found at http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/changelog/Hmisc.html. 
Changes made after 2004-11-24 should be ignored; these will be in the 
next version.

The most major change in Hmisc is that thanks to discussions with a 
highly respected, persistent, and convincing member of the R community, 
Hmisc no longer overrides [.factor to drop unused factor levels by 
default upon subsetting.  You can get the old behavior at any time by 
typing dropUnusedLevels().  A message to that effect appears when you 
attach the package.  Also Hmisc no longer overrides the interaction 
function, as the R builtin version provides the sep argument.  In the 
next version, the summary.formula function will be updated to 
automatically drop unused levels when this is appropriate.

Some other key changes are the addition of bubble plot capability in 
xYplot and addition of the capability of csv.get to correct certain date 
formatting inconsistencies.  sasxport.get now has keep and drop 
arguments to restrict attention to a subset of datasets when many 
datasets are being imported.  Other changes include bug and 
documentation fixes.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Quantian 0.6.9.2 with over 500 CRAN / BioC packages
Message-ID: <20041202044055.GA13834@sonny.eddelbuettel.com>

I posted the following a little earlier on the quantian-announce list -- but
it may be of interest here as well as this version contains all (but three,
see below) packages from CRAN, and all of BioConductor.

Quantian strives to provide the easiest way to set up a very complete
scientific computing environment with a wide variety of tools -- including
R, ESS, Ggobi, almost all of CRAN, all of BioConductor, as well as openMosix
support, and many more applications -- in minutes from a bootable dvd.

Feedback is always welcome, in particular on how to communicate more
directly with specific communities which may benefit from Quantian.  

Dirk



(Please see note [1] below regarding recipients for this posting. Thanks!)


Executive Summary: 

    Quantian 0.6.9.2 extends the Quantian series based on Knoppix 3.6 and the
    corresponding clusterKnoppix release. Over 475 new packages from CRAN and
    BioConductor provide unparalleled support for statistical computing, data
    analysis and graphical methods via the R environment and language.
    Several new packages have been added, and numerous other packages have
    been updated as well.


Announcing Quantian release 0.6.9.2
===================================


I   What is it?

    Quantian is a remastering of Knoppix, the self-configuring and directly
    bootable cdrom/dvd that turns any pc or laptop into a full-featured Linux
    workstation, and clusterKnoppix, which adds support for openMosix-based 
    cluster computing. However, Quantian differs from (cluster)Knoppix by
    adding a very large set of programs of interest to applied or theoretical
    workers in quantitative or data-driven fields. 

    See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian.html for more details.

    
II  What is new?

    o Second release based on Knoppix 3.6 adding 
        - over 500 R packages from CRAN and BioConductor (see next point)
        - several new packages such as labplot, python-matplotlib,
          python-gdal, subversion, tla, dia, ...
        - several packages with newer upstream versions such as R 2.0.1, gretl 1.3.0,
        - added most Recommended: packages for already installed packages
 
    o The main new feature is the unique support for almost all packages from
        - CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org), and 
        - BioConductor (http://www.bioconductor.org)
      About 60 packages are installed directly as Debian packages, and 478
      more are installed directly into /usr/local/lib/R/site-packages using
      the mechanisms provided by R, CRAN and BioConductor (and as such, these
      packages will not appear in the Debian package list).  
      The only missing CRAN packages are mimR (windows-only), ROracle
      (requires Oracle) and seao.gui which didn't build in batch mode.
      
    o Adding the Recommended: packages provides additional documentation, 
      as well as header files, which complements the installed packages.
     
    o Total size is 2.0 gb for the compressed iso image corresponding to
      almost 6 gb of uncompressed software. 

    o See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/changelog.html for details.

    o See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/howto.html for several
      short HOWTOs on booting Quantian from hd on either Windows or Linux,
      booting via a bootcd (such as clusterKnoppix), or botting from a 
      USB memory device.  Contributions, corrections, and feedback on these
      HOWTOs is always appreciated.


III Where do I get it?

    o Downloads are available from the main hosts already listed above, i.e.
      on the West Coast at

            http://www.analytics.washington.edu/downloads/quantian/

      and at the East Coast at

            http://research.warnes.net/downloads/quantian/CURRENT/
	    ftp://research.warnes.net/users/edd/quantian/CURRENT/

      The most recent release is also available at

            http://quantian.alioth.debian.org/

    o Bittorrents are available via

            http://www.analytics.washington.edu:6969/

    o The main European mirror has already caught up:

            http://sunsite.rediris.es/mirror/quantian

      and the second Sunsite mirror should hopefully catch up soon:

            http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/ftp/pub/Linux/quantian

    o CD/DVD vendors will probably update their offerings soon as well. 
      BudgetLinuxCDs.com is typically the fastest:

            http://www.budgetlinuxcds.com/index.php?page=Choose&letter=Q&sort=upd

      and CheapBytes should follow shortly:

            http://www.cheapbytes.com

      Pointers to other vendors are always appreciated.


IV  Mailing lists

    o Two mailing lists exist for Quantian

        quantian-announce	  for announcements, intended to be low volume
        quantian-general	  for general discussions about Quantian

      available via

        http://alioth.debian.org/mail/?group_id=1425

      for subscription info etc., and start using the quantian-general lists
      for general questions, comments, suggestions or discussions about 
      Quantian.

      Quantian-general is subscribed to quantian-announce, so you only need
      to subscribe to one (but can of course subscribe to both).

      Reply-To: for this message is quantian-general at lists.alioth.debian.org
      so that discussions can be continued on the list.


V  Known Bugs

    o Sound does not appear to get configured on my laptops.


VI   Other items

    o Feedback / poll on package additions or removal

      As always, I welcome comments and suggestions about programs to be
      added or removed. Existing Debian packages get pushed to the front of
      the line.

      Please send feedback, questions, comments, ... to the 
      
	quantian-general at lists.alioth.debian.org

      list to maximise the number of eyes glancing at any one question.

    o Feedback would also be appreciated on ways to better communicate with
      difference scientific communities that could be interested in Quantian.


VII Notes

    [1] This email is sent via the quantian-announce mailing list. I have
        subscribed those whose email addresses are in my quantian mail folder 
        due to prior emails. The quantian-announce mailing list only sends
        moderator-approved posts -- so there should be no spam whatsoever. I 
        also added LWN and DWN who had run previous announcements, and as 
        suggested, the openmosix-general, clusterknoppix and debian-knoppix 
        lists. Anybody who considers this unwanted is kindly asked to send me
        a private mail to get unsubscribed immediately.

Dear list members,

I've uploaded a new package, called polycor (version 0.5-0), to CRAN. The
package has functions for computing polychoric and polyserial correlations,
either by maximum-likelihood (in which case, standard errors are available)
or by faster approximations. There's also a function to compute
"heterogeneous" correlation matrices composed of product-moment, polychoric,
and polyserial correlations, as appropriate to each pair of variables.

Comments and suggestions would be appreciated.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0412231329140.23821@thorin.ci.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear useRs,

a new and much improved version of the zoo package for indexed totally
ordered observations (such as irregular time series) is available from
CRAN. It allows indexing observations with time/index vectors of arbitrary
class and extends many of the standard generic functions also available
for "ts" objects. Additionally, it allows conversion from/to other
(irregular) time series classes such as "its" and "irts". A vignette that
explains the features of zoo is also available in the package. For further
details see also the list of changes below.

Seasonal greetings,
Z


Changes in Version 0.9-1

  o new generic functions ORDER() and MATCH() (with
    order() and match() as the default) so that zoo()
    can handle  arbitrary index/time classes when
    suitable methods for the generic function c(),
    length(), order(), match() and subsetting [, are
    supplied.

  o improved printing of "zoo" objects and added
    a summary() method.

  o extended coercion functionality to and from
    "zoo" objects. "its" objects can be coerced to
    "zoo" and vice versa. "zoo" objects can be
    coerced to vector, matrix, data.frame or list.

  o added functionality to extract/assign to
    the coredata() of a "zoo" object.

  o added/improved functionality to extract/assign
    to the window() of a "zoo" object.

  o added/improved functionality to extract/assign
    to the index() or time() of a "zoo" object.

  o added lag(), diff(), start(), end(), head(),
    tail() methods.

  o improved plot.zoo() by more flexible expansion
    of plotting parameters such as col, lty and pch.

  o added a cbind() method for "zoo" objects (almost
    synonymous with merge())

  o NA handling for "zoo" objects via na.omit(),
    na.contiguous(), na.approx() and na.locf().

  o na.locf() generic function with default method (suitable
    for "zoo" objects) which implements Last Observation
    Carried Forward.

  o na.approx() generic function with default method (suitable
    for "zoo" objects) which implements elimination of NAs
    by interpolation.

  o added mathematical methods: group generic functions
    for "zoo" objects, t(), cumsum(), cumprod(), cummin(),
    and cummax().

  o added model.frame.AsIs and model.frame.zoo to support
    regression based on zoo objects, in particular with lm()
    (but also many other regression functions).

  o Zero length vector zoo objects may have non-zero index vectors
    intended to be used in merge to extend zoo objects. zoo
    changed to enable the creation of such objects by omitting
    first argument.

  o added a vignette explaining the new features

Subject: [R-pkgs] new version of randomForest (4.0-7)
Message-ID: <3A822319EB35174CA3714066D590DCD504AF75EB@usrymx25.merck.com>

Dear R users,

I've just released a new version of randomForest (available on CRAN now).
This version contained quite a number of new features and bug fixes,
compared to version prior to 4.0-x (and few more since 4.0-1).

For those not familiar with randomForest, it's an ensemble
classifier/regression tool.  Please see
http://www.math.usu.edu/~adele/forests/ for more detailed information, as
well as the Fortran code.

Comments/questions/bugs reports/patches much appreciated! 

A few notes about the new version:

o  There is a new tuneRF() function for searching for the optimal mtry,
following Breiman's suggestion.  PLEASE use it to see if result can be
improved!

o  A new variable importance measure replaces the one based on margin.  This
new measure is the same as in Breiman's V5.  The analogous measure is also
implemented for regression.  This new measure is designed to be more robust
against data where predictor variables have very different number of
possible splits (i.e., unique values/categories).  The previous measure
tends to make variables with more possible splits look more important.

o  For classification, the new meassure is also computed on a per-class
basis.

o  There is the new `sampsize' option for down-sampling larger classes.
E.g., if in a two-class problem, there are 950 class 1s and 50 class 2s, use
sampsize=c(50, 50) will usually give a more `balanced' classifier.

o  There is a new importance() function for extracting the importance
measure.

o  The predict() method has an option to return predictions by the component
trees.

o  There is a new getTree() function for looking at one of the trees in the
forest. 

o  For dealing with missing values in the predictor variables, there are
na.roughfix() and rfImpute(), which correspond to the `missquick' and
`missright' options in Breiman's V4/V5 code.  Both works for classification
as well as regression.

o  There is an experimental bias reduction step in regression (the corr.bias
argument in randomForest) that could be very effective for some data (but
essentially no effect for some others).


Some notes about differences between the package and Breiman's Fortran code:

o  Breiman uses the class weights to cast weighted votes.  This is not done
in the R version.  However, one can use the threshold argument to
randomForest to get similar (but not exactly the same) effect.

o  In Breiman's V4/V5 code, the Gini-based importance is weighted by the
out-of-bag data.  This has not been implemented in the R version.

o  Breiman's V4/V5 code can handle categorical predictors with more than 32
categories.  This has not been implemented in the R version.

o  Breiman's classification code uses mtry differently than the R version:
the mtry variables are sampled *with replacement* at each node.  The R
version samples without replacement, so that if mtry is set to number of
predictors, one gets the same result as bagging.  Breiman's regression code
*does* sample the variables without replacement.

o  In the R version, ties are randomly broken when finding best variables,
or when making predictions.  In Breiman's code, the first one found wins.

o  The `prototypes' Breiman described have not been implemented.  There are
situations when they can be misleading, so I have chosen not to implement
it.

o  The `interaction detection' feature in Breiman's V5 has not been
implemented (but is fairly high on my to-do list).


Best,
Andy

AlgDesign is a new package for calculating algorithmic experimental
designs. It will calculate both exact and approximate designs for a
variety of criteria. It will handle very large designs. It will also
block designs in a variety of ways, including split plotting. You should
find it at least as capable as other software for this purpose.

I'd normally submit this sort of thing to beta test, but I guess the R
users are the beta testers, so have at it. It would probably be best to
send the bug reports directly to me rather then clutter up the newsgroups.

Message-ID: <16437.32492.977572.998974@musil.localdomain>


We would like to announce the availability on CRAN of a new package
multinomRob.  It does robust estimation of overdispersed multinomial
regression models. The package is also able to estimate overdispersed
grouped multinomial logistic and multivariate-t logistic models.  The
code is relatively general; for example, it allows for equality
constraints across parameters and it can handle datasets in which the
number of categories varies by observation.

DESCRIPTION:

Package: multinomRob

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package -- mvpart
Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.2.20040217102016.01d808f8@mail.aims.gov.au>

The package mvpart is now available.
mvpart includes partitioning based on (1) multivariate numeric responses and
(2) dissimilarity matrices.

The package mvpart is a modification of rpart --
  -- authors of original: Terry M Therneau and Beth Atkinson 
<atkinson at mayo.edu>, and
  R port of rpart Brian Ripley <ripley at stats.ox.ac.uk>.
Includes some modified routines from vegan -- Jari Oksanen 
<jari.oksanen at oulu.fi>

Thanks and credit to all the above.

Modifications of rpart to mvpart by Glenn De'ath <g.death at aims.gov.au>.

It was not possible to simply build a separate packge which required RPART due
to the modifications to the rpart C-code necessary to include the 2 new
partitioning methods.

As few changes as possible have been made to rpart.

In addition to the changes in the C-code, the following changes and 
additions in
R-functions have been made.

(1) A wrapper function for rpart called mvpart supports selection of trees 
by x-validation,
         interactive display, printing of results etc.

(2) Some multivariate methods to deal with representation and 
interpretation of multivariate
         partitioning objects have been added. These include PCA plots and 
tree-cluster comparisons.

(3) Methods for calculating increased forms of dissimilarities and for 
scaling matrices
         have been added. These are designed in particluar for community 
ecology.

(3) text.rpart has been modified to include graphical annotation of nodes.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Package "ref" implements references and referenceable
	data.frames for the S-language
Message-ID: <17540.1077553011@www6.gmx.net>


Repeatedly people have asked how to pass arguments by reference in R.

Now package "ref"  is on CRAN, which provides two referencing methods:

Functions ref(), deref() and friends conveniently allow to pass parameters
"by reference" instead of  "by value". This can be useful in memory critical
applications but requires a more careful programming style to track the
implications of functions changing their parameters. However, package ref is
written in pure S and attaching this package does not change any standard S
behaviour. 

Class refdata is a transparent wrapper to matrices and data.frames which
allows for memory efficient nested subsetting. I.e. you can create a subset
of a
subset ... of a data.frame without duplicating the data in memory, instead
only indexing information is duplicated. Indexing information is represented
as positive or negative integers, whatever is shorter, thus the length of
the
index is granted to be <=nrows/2 resp. <=ncol/2. Memory savings in case of a
square data.frame is roughly n^2-n elements per level of nested subsetting.

This code is offered "as is" under the GPL, usage is completely at your own
risk. (Some efforts has been put in the included regression tests to make
shure
the code does what it is intended to do).

Feedback about problems or successful example uses is welcome.
Please use the email address given in the package DESCRIPTION and please
don't cc to lists for spam prevention.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package: DCluster
Message-ID: <1078931928.2622.36.camel@chomsky.estadi.uv.es>

Dear R users,

I am glad to announce the release of a new package for R: DCluster. It
implements a number of methods for the detection of clusters of disease.
It includes methods to test Poisson extra-variation (Chi-square test and
Potthoff-Whittinghill's test), Spatial Autocorrelation (Moran's I and
Geary's c), general clustering (Whittermore's statistic and Tango's
statistic), scan methods (Openshaw's GAM, Besag & Newell's methods and
Kulldorff & Nagarwalla's statistic) and a focused test (Stone's Test).

Bootstrap is used to estimate significance and a number of models are
proposed to simulate data: permutations and Poisson, Multinomial or Neg.
Binomial distributions.

I hope the package will be useful to epidemiologists and statisticians
involved in spatial epidemiological studies. As usual, feedback and
comments are welcome. Our hope is to improve the package, so suggestions
about new methods to be added are of interest.

With best regards,

Subject: [R-pkgs] Subselect package - Version 0.7.1
Message-ID: <E1B1P1l-0003PO-00@DMjcadima>


A new  version (0.7.1) of package 'subselect' has been uploaded to CRAN.

Package 'subselect' provides functions which assess the quality of
variable subsets as surrogates for a full data set, in an exploratory
data analysis, and search for subsets which are optimal under various
criteria. 

As of version 0.7 a new function 'leaps' has been added. 'Leaps'
performs a branch and bound search for the best variable subsets,
according to a specified criterion. 'Leaps' implements Duarte Silva's
adaptation (Reference 3) of Furnival and Wilson's Leaps and Bounds
Algorithm for variable selection in Regression Analysis. It is viable in
identifying optimal subsets for data sets with a moderate number
(up to about 30-35) of variables, and very fast for small data sets
(up to about 20-25 variables).

In package subselect, the quality of given k-subsets of variables are
assessed under three criteria (Reference 2). 

Three additional functions, 'anneal', 'genetic' and 'improve', search for
optimal k-variable subsets under those criteria, using three different
algorithms: a simulated annealing algorithm, a genetic algorithm and a
restricted local improvement algorithm (Reference 1). Among the
options, the user can control number of iterations, initial
temperature, cooling factors and cooling frequency in simulated
annealing, and number of generations, population size, admissibility
of clones and presence and frequency of mutations in the 
genetic algorithm. 

For all algorithms, it is possible to specify the number
of solutions required in one or more cardinalities and to force the solutions 
to include and/or to exclude given subsets of variables.


Here is the DESCRIPTION file for the package:

Subject: [R-pkgs] New versions: mvbutils and debug packages
Message-ID: <C4178DC99E08604EA5E2BDB989F09380090C8D@EXTAS2-HBA.tas.csiro.au>

Dear R users

New versions of the 'mvbutils' and 'debug' packages are now available on CRAN, both in source form and as precompiled binaries.

'mvbutils' offers the following (as well as many miscellaneous utilities):

  ?  hiearchical, searchable project organization, with workspaces switchable inside a single R session, and objects in "ancestor" projects always visible in R from "child" projects;
  ?  function editing (interface to text editors), with multiple simultaneous edits, an "unfrozen" R prompt, and automatic backup;
  ?  function code and plain-text documentation stored in the same R object, and editable in the same file;
  ?  informal plain-text documentation via help, and conversion to Rd format;
  ?  nested 'source'ing, and interspersal of R code and data in the same file;
  ?  macro-like functions, executing inside their caller's environment;
  ?  untangling and display of "what calls what" within groups of functions.

'debug' is for debugging functions (yours or other people's). It requires 'mvbutils'. 'debug' offers:

  ?  a visible code window with line-numbered code and highlighted execution point;
  ?  the ability to set (conditional) breakpoints in advance, at any line number;
  ?  the opportunity to keep going after errors;
  ?  multiple debugging windows open at once (when one debuggee calls another, or itself);
  ?  full debugging of 'on.exit' code;
  ?  the ability to move the execution point around without executing intervening statements;
  ?  direct interpretation of typed-in statements, as if they were in the function itself.

For further information on 'debug', see the article "Debugging without (too many) tears" in R-news 3/3.

The new versions fix a few minor bugs in the 1.0.0 releases, as documented in the CHANGES.TXT files in each package.

Subject: [R-pkgs] mgcv 1.0 
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.58.0403161058130.29943@moon.stats.gla.ac.uk>

mgcv 1.0 (package providing gams etc) will be released with R 1.9.0.
(R 1.8.x compatible versions can be found at:
http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/~simon/simon/mgcv.html)
There are quite a few changes from mgcv 0.9: hence this message.

The main new features are:

* A generalized additive mixed modelling function `gamm' (which uses lme
  from the nlme library of glmmPQL from the MASS library for fitting).

* Tensor product smooths as an alternative way of representing smooths of
  more than one variable. These are useful when isotropic smoothing is
  inappropriate. Tensor products of any available smooth can be used.
  See ?te

* An object oriented approach to smooth terms that allows new classes of
  smooths to be added easily. See ?smooth.construct for details and
  example R code implementing `p-splines'.

* A built in cyclic smooth class for terms where the beginning is the
  end...

Partly as a result of the above the code has undergone some fairly major
re-organization, which means that ...

1. The new version is not fully back compatible with previous versions.
   For example version 1.0 plotting or summary functions will not work with
   gam objects from previous versions of mgcv.

2. There's likely to be the odd teething problem - please let me know
   about them so they can get fixed.

Subject: [R-pkgs] new version of abind()
Message-ID: <6.0.3.0.2.20040320142045.090d76d8@wheresmymailserver.com>

There is a new version of the abind package on CRAN (abind_1.1-0).  abind() 
is a multi-dimensional generalization of cbind() and rbind() -- it can bind 
multiple 2-d matrices into a 3-d array, or bind 3-d arrays together, etc.

In this new version the behavior of the function abind() has been enhanced 
slightly (it can now accept a list as the first argument, removing the need 
to use do.call() in most situtations), and changed slightly (to no longer 
by default creates dimension names if none exist, because these are usually 
useless and mostly annoying).  There is also a new function in the package: 
adrop(), which does approximately what drop() does, but allows control over 
which dimensions are dropped.

Note also that the abind() function runs under S-plus as well (I believe 
adrop() does as well, but it is not as well tested).

Details:

2004-03-12

         * R/abind.R man/abind.Rd
         allow first argument of abind() to be a list of objects to be
         bound -- this avoids the need for do.call() when one wants to bind
         a list of objects

         * R/abind.R man/abind.Rd
         changed argument name 'use.anon.names' to the more intuitive
         'make.names' (the argument 'use.anon.names' still works)

         * R/abind.R man/abind.Rd
         changed default value for 'make.names' to FALSE (now more closely
         behaves like rbind() and cbind()).  This means that dimension
           names for dimensions that have no names are only constructed
           when requested, not by default.

         * R/adrop.R man/adrop.Rd
         added new function adrop().  This is a function like drop(), but it
           allows to user to specify which of the dimensions with extent one
           will be dropped.


Please let me know of any problems.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Moron v0.6.0b released
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.51.0403271325160.27230@localhost.localdomain>


We are pleased to announce that the development of the
notorious "Method for Object Recognition of Obscure Nature"
(or Moron, for short) has been switched to the R language.

Given a directory of images (i.e. jpegs), Moron attempts
to predict a category distribution for the content of each
image. The default categories modelled are {healthy,pron,
latex/fetish,japanese_cg,manga,b/w photo}. Supposing
good statistical models can be designed for problems
like these, Moron could eventually be usable as a spam filter
for visual data or to sort images, depending on your taste.
Currently it is not accurate enough for production use.

The Moron package contains a data.frame to estimate a
model to recognize the default categories, and source code
to evaluate new images, collect new training sets (this
can be done simply by putting images of different classes
to different directories and running a few provided functions)
and train new classifiers. The included Local Binary Pattern
(LBP) feature extractors and RGB<->HSV conversion routines
might be of aside interest.

Due to its ability to visualize the predictions made
per image region, Moron is a guaranteed hit in both
parties and classrooms, if only given a juicy enough set
of test images. Even layman (male) audience has been
seen to be captivated by the antics of Moron, efficiently
rivalling traditional aquariums and fireplaces.

Moron is released under GPL. Version 0.6.0b for R can be dl'ed from

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7434&package_id=68958

The package relies on R libraries 'randomForest' and 'pixmap'.
It has been developed on Linux, but is probably usable on
other systems with only a few simple modifications.


Have fun,
Igor

Subject: [R-pkgs] energy 1.0.1
Message-ID: <p04310101bc909e38eb73@[129.1.87.58]>


R Users,

We would like to announce that Version 1.0.1 of the energy package is
now available on CRAN.

The energy package introduces a new class of statistical tests based
on the concept of Newton's potential energy. Included in the package are

    * mvnorm.etest (test) and mvnorm.e (statistic)
      A rotation invariant multivariate goodness-of-fit test,
      implemented for testing multivariate normality with
      estimated parameters

    * eqdist.etest (test) and ksample.e (statistic)
      A k-sample multivariate nonparametric test of equal distributions
      (arbitrary number of samples and arbitrary dimension)
      with optional incomplete statistics to support testing
      arbitrarily large samples

    * energy.hclust and edist
      Hierarchical clustering based on e-distances and
      cluster distance function

    * poisson.mtest (test) and poisson.m (statistic)
      Mean distance test of Poisson distribution, estimated mean

Here is a brief summary of the potential energy background of the
tests in the energy package:

Newton's gravitational force is inversely proportional to squared
Euclidean distances between pairs of objects, and the potential
energy is inversely proportional to their Euclidean distances. The
simplest choice for the absolute value of the force is constant, and
then the potential energy is proportional to the Euclidean distances
between pairs of objects. In statistics, the objects are the observed
random vectors, and thus our energy terms are Euclidean distances
between the pairs of sample elements: ||x_i - x_j||. Tests are based
on the Theorem that a suitable linear combination of these distances
(the potential energy of the 'statistical situation') is always
nonnegative, and equals 0 if and only if the null hypothesis holds.

Comments and suggestions are welcome. The description file is below.

gregmisc 0.10.1
---------------

gregmisc 0.10.1 is now available at ftp://cran.r-project.org/incoming/ and
will move to the regular contributed packages location
(http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES.html#gregmisc) as soon as
the CRAN administrators get caught up.

Recent Changes
---------------

Version 0.10.1

- Fixed bug in textplot() reported by Kevin Wright  <kevin.d.wright at
pioneer
  dot com>.

Version 0.10.0

- Now works with and requires R 1.9.0

- Added ooplot() function that mimics Open-Office style plots.
  Contributed by Lodewijk Bonebakker <bonebakker at comcast.net>

- Fixed bug in running() that arose when the called function
  really needed a minimum number of elements to work on.

- Added several new features to running(), it can now allow sequences
  shorter than the requested width to be present at the front, the back,
  or on both sides of the full lenth sequences.  This allows one to
  align the data so that the window is before, after, or around the
  indexed point.

- Add enhancements to estimable() provided by S?ren H?jsgaard
  <sorenh at agrsci.dk>:

  The estimable function now
  1) also works on geese and gee objects and
  2) can test hypotheses af the forb L * beta = beta0 both as a
     single Wald test and row-wise for each row in L.

- Add colorpanel function, which generates a smoothly varying band of
  colors over a three color range (lo, mid, high).

Hi to all R users,

I have just uploaded in CRAN R2HTML 1.3, latest update of the R2HTML 
package, so that it should soon be available for your favorite platform.


CHANGELOG:
- Fixed some user-contributed bugs.
- More CSS styles are defined, so that it's possible to change the whole 
look-and-feel of outputs / Add some CSS sample files.
- Added HTMLstem to produce a stem-and-leaf plot (as stem does directly 
print to console).
- Added HTML.cormat, which is not a real S3 method but allows to write 
correlation matrices with "traffic highlighting" (colours).
- Added a Sweave driver (for Friedrich Leisch wonderfull Sweave tool) which 
allows to include R code within complex HTML files and to replace this code 
by it's outputs (objects in HTML and graphs in png). Comes with sample files.
- Dynamic use with HTMLStart() has a new option 'autobrowse' which 
auto-refresh (callls) the browser each time a command is processed.

DESCRIPTION:

Depends: R (>= 1.8.1)
Description: Includes HTML function and methods to write in an HTML file. 
Thus, making HTML reports is easy. Includes a fonction that allows 
redirection on the fly, which appears to be very usefull for teaching 
purpose, as the student can keep a copy of the produced output to keep all 
that he did during the course. Package comes with a vignette describing how 
to write HTML reports for statistical analysis. Finally, a driver for 
Sweave allows to parse HTML flat files containing R code and to 
automatically write the corresponding outputs (tables and graphs).

Hi,

this is to announce a new version (1.1-2) of my package fpc. Apart from
the stuff already present in the older version (methods for fixed point
clustering and clusterwise regression, somewhat bug-cleaned and with
faster examples) there is now a function cluster.stats, which computes
some distance-based statistics often used for cluster validation,
description and decision about the number of clusters, including the
so-called corrected rand index and some further methods mentioned in the
Gordon 1999 book on Classification.

Best,
Christian

Message-ID: <408D5745.7000203@uni-bayreuth.de>

We would like to announce the availability on CRAN of a new package distr .
It is to provide a conceptual treatment of random variables (r.v.'s) by 
means of
S4--classes. A virtual mother class "Distribution" is introduced.
All distributions of the "base" package are implemented as subclasses of
either "AbscontDistribution" or "DiscreteDistribution".

Using these classes, we also provide (default) methods to automatically
generate the image distributions under unary mathematical operations as
well as a general convolution algorithm.

Additionally, we also provide classes for a standardized treatment of
simulations (also under contaminations) and evaluations of statistical
procedures on such simulations.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Release candidate 1 of lme4_0.6-1
Message-ID: <6roepcq87v.fsf@bates4.stat.wisc.edu>

Deepayan Sarkar and I have a source package of release candidate 1 of
the 0.6 series of the lme4 package available at
         http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~bates/lme4_0.6-0-1.tar.gz
This package requires Matrix_0.8-6 which has been uploaded to CRAN and
should be available in a few days.  A copy of the source package is
available as
         http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~bates/Matrix_0.8-6.tar.gz

Although this version of lme4 passes "R CMD check" on our GNU/Linux
systems we have not uploaded it to CRAN because it still lacks
capabilities that are available in lme4_0.5-2, which is currently on
CRAN.  As soon as we have all the capabilities of the 0.5 series
available in the 0.6 series we will release lme4_0.6-1.tar.gz to CRAN.

This version of lme4 is a complete rewrite of the data structures and
algorithms for fitting linear mixed models.  An incomplete draft
version of a paper describing the methods is available as a vignette.
Subsequent releases will contain a more polished version of this
paper.

The big change relative to earlier versions is that you can fit models
with crossed random effects quickly and easily.  For example, using
the data on Scottish secondary school students achievement scores
(from http://multilevel.ioe.ac.uk/softrev/) we can fit a model with
random effects for both the secondary and the primary school attended
as

There are other examples in the tests subdirectory.  

The lme function behaves as previously *with one exception*.  In the
model specification there is no longer any distinction between crossed
or nested or partially crossed random effects.  This means that for
nested random effects you must ensure that every inner grouping
corresponds to a unique level of the inner grouping factor.  For
example, in the Pixel data there are two grouping factors, Dog and
Side with Side nested within Dog.  You must create a new grouping
factor, say DS, with unique levels for each Dog/Side combination to be
able to specify a model of "Side within Dog".

Message-ID: <6rbrk36kjo.fsf@bates4.stat.wisc.edu>

I have uploaded release 0.6-1 of the lme4 package to the incoming area
on CRAN.  I expect it will be transferred to the archive within a
couple of days, after which Uwe's Windows build daemon should be able
to get it to build a Windows version.  The lme4 package itself is a
pure R package (i.e. it does not contain any code to be compiled) but
it depends on the Matrix_0.8-7 package which has a considerable amount
of C code in it.

This package contains the version of lme that I spoke of at useR!2004.
Using sparse matrix methods - in particular, Tim Davis' LDL package -
we are able to fit models with crossed random effects quickly and
effectively.  This package also contains an implementation of GLMM for
Generalized Linear Mixed Models using either Penalized
Quasi-Likelihood (PQL) or ML estimation using the Laplacian
approximation to the marginal likelihood.  At present method =
'Laplace' is considerably slower than method = 'PQL'.  We would
recommend using PQL for model building and determining final parameter
estimates using method = 'Laplace'.

Feedback is welcome.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New versions of Hmisc and Design on CRAN
Message-ID: <40C0735F.8050204@vanderbilt.edu>

New versions of source packages for Hmisc and Design are available from 
CRAN for R 1.9 on Linux/Unix.   Knowing Uwe Ligges, a Windows binary is 
not far behind.  Changelogs are at 
http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/ChangelogHmisc and
http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/ChangelogDesign . 
These versions pass R CMD check for the latest R-devel so I expect they 
will work on the next production release of R.

Of special note is the Hmisc sasxport.get function's new method='csv' 
argument.  This works with a SAS macro to use SAS PROC EXPORT to export 
an entire data library, and handles variable and value labels, date, 
time, data/time variables [for dates, the new R Date class is now used 
as is also now used for sas.get, spss.get, csv.get].  We have found the 
new SAS import method in sasxport.get to be the most reliable way to 
convert datasets from SAS if you can run SAS on your system or on a 
server.  An example may be found at 
http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/SASexportHowto and 
the SAS macro is at 
http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/pub/Main/Hmisc/exportlib.sas . 
The main page for Hmisc is http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/s/Hmisc . 
sasxport.get largely supplants sas.get.

For those users who are not familiar with the Hmisc/LaTeX combination, 
have a look at 
http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/pub/Main/StatReport/summary.pdf

Thanks to Kurt Hornik for always providing such an excellent service to 
the community through his work on CRAN.

CRAN at http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/gregmisc.html for
both Unix and Windows systems.

The most notable enhancement provided by this release is:

- read.xls(), a function to read Microsoft Excel files by
  translating them to csv files via the xls2csv.pl script has
  been added.  I've also provided Unix and MS-Windows scripts 
  in <R_LIBRARY_DIR>/gregmisc/bin which allow you to call 
  xls2csv directly.  The code uses perl libraries which are
  included in the package, so perl must be in the execution path.

Other enhancements include:

- Improvements to CrossTable() by Marc Schwartz <MSchwartz at MedAnalytics.com>

- Improvements to ooplot() by Lodewijk Bonebakker <bonebakker at comcast.net>

- plotCI() and plotmeans() now have improved argument handling.

- The running() function now has an additional parameter `simplify'
  which controls whether the returned values are simplified into a
  vector/matrix or left as a list.

- A makefile that will download and attempt to install all available
  packages from CRAN and Bioconductor is now provided in
  $PACKAGE$/gregmisc/tools/

- space() can now space points along the 'y' dimension.

- Fix an error in the permutations code for repeats.allow=T and r>2.
  Both the bug report and fix are from Elizabeth Purdom
  <epurdom at stanford.edu>.

- Various fixes for compatibility with R 1.9.X.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package: RUnit
Message-ID: <40C9B6C6.1020604@epigenomics.com>

We would like to announce the availability on CRAN of a new package: RUnit

It contains a unit testing framework strongly inspired by Javas popular 
JUint package. In addition it contains some functionality to investigate 
the degree to which some function is covered by a test suite.

The main aims of the package are
- to support a development style where test cases are written and 
constantly executed parallel to implementing the actual functinality.
- to deliver the results of a test run in a format as structured and 
helpful as possible.

Besides the usual function documentation the doc subdirectory contains a 
pdf file with additional information.


Questions, comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Happy testing

Subject: [R-pkgs] gstat 0.9-12: cokriging cross validation and class name
	incompatibilities
Message-ID: <40CFFB52.4040102@geog.uu.nl>

I uploaded gstat 0.9-12 to CRAN, which has a few important changes:

1. Cokriging cross validation

Cokriging cross validation is now possible with the function gstat.cv:
you simply pass a multivariable gstat object, and cross validation is done
for the first variable in the object. Optionally, secondary variable 
records
at locations coinciding with the validation locations are removed.

2. Class name changes

Both gstat and geoR used the name "variogram" for -- highly incompatible --
objects that contain information about a variogram. This led to errors when
calling plot() with a variogram object calculated from one, but plotted by
the other package. I changed the class name into "gstatVariogram". The full
list of class name changes:

variogram -> gstatVariogram
point.pairs -> pointPairs
variogram.map -> variogramMap
variogram.cloud -> variogramCloud

You can still run scripts you have with the new packages, but e.g. plot(v)
when v is an old object of class "variogram" will not work with the new
package. As these are S3 classes, a simple solution would be to
reassign the class:

class(v) = c("gstatVariogram", "data.frame")

3. Compatibility with package sp and variogram maps
On http://sourceforge.net/projects/r-spatial/ beta releases for the upcoming
package sp are available; sp provides classes and methods for spatial data.
Instead of:

 > library(gstat)
 > data(meuse)
 > variogram(zinc~1, ~x+y, meuse)

you could, with package sp loaded, do:

 > coordinates(meuse) = ~x+y # promotes meuse to SpatialDataFrame
 > variogram(zinc~1, meuse) # no coordinates required.

In addition, sp provides classes for gridded data and polygon data. With sp
loaded, gstat can calculate variogram maps.

Any comments are welcome,

Subject: [R-pkgs] R (D)COM server, new release
Message-ID: <40D85970.8090506@univie.ac.at>

Today we uploaded a new release of the
R (D)COM server for Windows to CRAN.
It is release 1.35

The software is much more stable, and there are
quite a few improvements.

Excerpts from the NEWS file:

RServerManager has been added. This provides a repository for R COM 
servers.  See the samples and the additional documentation

Partial rewrite of the code for SetSymbol() and GetSymbol().
Now arrays of VARIANTs are supported to some degree.
This makes the COM server accessible to many scripting languages

Sample usage for JScript, Python, and VBScript added

New tools library provided for Excel to remotely access COM server
without the need for local installation

The software should appear on CRAN in the "Other" section
within the next few days.

MNP: R Package for Fitting the Multinomial Probit Models

Abstract:
MNP is a publicly available R package that fits the Bayesian multinomial
probit models via Markov chain Monte Carlo. Along with the standard
multinomial probit model, it can also fit models with different choice
sets for each observation, and complete or partial ordering of all the
available alternatives. The computation is based on the efficient marginal
data augmentation algorithm that is developed by Imai and van Dyk (2004)  
``A Bayesian Analysis of the Multinomial Probit Model Using the Data
Augmentation,'' Journal of Econometrics, Forthcoming.

Subject: [R-pkgs] randomForest 4.3-0 released
Message-ID: <3A822319EB35174CA3714066D590DCD504AF7FF4@usrymx25.merck.com>

Dear all,

Version 4.3-0 of the randomForest package is now available on CRAN (in
source; binaries will follow in due course).  There are some interface
changes and a few new features, as well as bug fixes.  For those who had
used previous versions, the important things to note are: 1. there's a
namespace now, and 2. some functions have been renamed.  The list of changes
since 4.0-7 (last public release) is shown below.

As many changes were made to the package, it's very likely that new bugs
have crept in.  I'd very much appreciate bug reports or even patches!

The plan is still to add features to the package so that it matches the
features in Breiman and Cutler's latest Fortran version.  There is also plan
to add some functions so that the package will work with Adele Cutler's Java
visualization program (RAFT).

Best,
Andy

====================================================
Changes in 4.3-0:

* Thanks to Adele Cutler, there's now casewise variable importance 
  measures in classification.  Similar feature is also added for 
  regression.  Use the new localImp option in randomForest().

* The `importance' component of randomForest object has been changed:  
  The permutation-based measures are not divided by their `standard 
  errors'.  Instead, the `standard errors' are stored in the 
  `importanceSD' component.  One should use the importance() extractor 
  function rather than something like rf.obj$importance for extracting 
  the importance measures.

* The importance() extractor function has been updated:  If the 
  permutation-based measures are available, calling importance() 
  with only a randomForest object returns the matrix of variable 
  importance measures.  There is the `scale' argument, which defaults 
  to TRUE.

* In predict.randomForest, there is a new argument `nodes' (default to 
  FALSE).  For classification, if nodes=TRUE, the returned object has an
  attribute `nodes', which is an n by ntree matrix of terminal node
  indicators.  This is ignored for regression.

Changes in 4.2-1:

* There is now a package name space.  Only generics are exported.

* Some function names have been changed: 
    partial.plot -> partialPlot
    var.imp.plot -> varImpPlot
    var.used     -> varUsed

* There is a new option `replace' in randomForest() (default to TRUE)
  indicating whether the sampling of cases is with or without
  replacement. 

* In randomForest(), the `sampsize' option now works for both
  classification and regression, and indicate the number of cases to be 
  drawn to grow each tree.  For classification, if sampsize is a vector of
  length the number of classes, then sampling is stratified by class.

* With the formula interface for randomForest(), the default na.action,	
  na.fail, is effective.  I.e., an error is given if there are NAs present
  in the data.  If na.omit is desired, it must be given explicitly.

* For classification, the err.rate component of the randomForest object
  (and the corresponding one for test set) now is a ntree by (nclass + 1)
  matrix, the first column of which contains the overall error rate, and
  the remaining columns the class error rates.  The running output now
  also prints class error rates.  The plot method for randomForest will
  plot the class error rates as well.

* The predict() method now checks whether the variable names in newdata 
  match those from the training data (if the randomForest object is not
  created from the formula interface).

* partialPlot() and varImpPlot() now have optional arguments xlab, ylab
  and main for more flexible labelling.  Also, if a factor is given as
  the variable, a real bar plot is produced.

* partialPlot() will now remove rows with NAs from the data frame given.

* For regression, if proximity=FALSE, an n by n array of integers is 
  erroneously allocated but not used (it's only used for proximity 
  calculation, so not needed otherwise).

* Updated combine() to conform to the new randomForest object.

* na.roughfix() was not working correctly for matrices, which in turns 
  causes problem in rfImpute().

 
Changes in 4.1-0:

* In randomForest(), if sampsize is given, the sampling is now done
  without replacement, in addition to stratified by class.  Therefore 
  sampsize can not be larger than the class frequencies.

* In classification randomForest, checks are added to avoid trees with 
  only the root node.

* Fixed a bug in the Fortran code for classification that caused segfault 
  on some system when encountering a tree with only root node.

* The help page for predict.randomForest() now states the fact that when 
  newdata is not specified, the OOB predictions from the randomForest 
  object is returned.

* plot.randomForest() and print.randomForest() were not checking for 
  existence of performance (err.rate or mse) on test data correctly.

Message-ID: <40FDE625.3030506@jhsph.edu>

We would like to announce release of version 0.3-3 of the 
NMMAPSdata package.  NMMAPSdata is an R package which contains 
time series data on air pollution, weather, and mortality for 108 
United States cities for the years 1987--2000.  These data were 
originally assembled for the National Morbidity, Mortality, and 
Air Pollution Study sponsored by the Health Effects Institute and 
have since been updated.  While the data have been publicly 
available for some time now, NMMAPSdata, in addition to being a 
convenience for R users, assembles all of the city data into one 
package and contains some utility functions for managing the 
database.

NMMAPSdata can be downloaded from

http://www.ihapss.jhsph.edu/data/NMMAPS/R/

The package comes with a vignette which contains an overview of 
the data and a few example analyses.

Comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Message-ID: <1091440669.410e101d6cd9a@www.cx.unibe.ch>

Dear all,

I would like to announce the availability of a new package on CRAN:

RNetCDF: R Interface to NetCDF Datasets

This package provides an interface to Unidata's NetCDF library functions 
(version 3) and furthermore access to Unidata's udunits calendar
conversions. The routines and the documentation follow the NetCDF and
udunits C interface, so the corresponding manuals can be consulted for
more detailed information.

The main aims of this package are:
- to provide full read/write access to all NetCDF datasets (supporting
  all external NetCDF data types)
- to provide a low level interface which allows the user to write his
  own (customized) NetCDF read/write functions in a simple way

This package requires Unidata's NetCDF and the undunits library already 
installed on the system, which are both available from Unidata's website
(http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/).


Feedback is greatly appreciated.

Pavel


I would like to thank Juerg Schmidli for his excellent comments and
suggestions during the development process of this package and This
Rutishauser for testing the package from the user's perspective.

Subject: [R-pkgs] gam --- a new contributed package
Message-ID: <030f01c47bdb$c8d6a160$ec6640ab@stuk>

I have contributed a "gam" library to CRAN,
which implements "Generalized Additive Models".

This implementation follows closely the description in 
the GAM chapter 7 of the "white" book "Statistical Models in S"
(Chambers & Hastie (eds), 1992, Wadsworth), as well as the philosophy
in "Generalized Additive Models" (Hastie & Tibshirani 1990, Chapman and
Hall). Hence it behaves pretty much like the Splus version of GAM.

Note: this gam library and functions therein are different from the
gam function in package mgcv, and both libraries should not be used
simultaneously.

The gam library allows both local regression (loess) and smoothing
spline smoothers, and uses backfitting and local scoring to fit gams.
It also allows users to supply their own smoothing methods which can
then be included in gam fits.

The gam function in mgcv uses only smoothing spline smoothers, with a
focus on automatic parameter selection via gcv. 

Some of the features of the gam library:

* full compatibility with the R functions glm and lm - a fitted gam
  inherits from class "glm" and "lm"

* print, summary, anova, predict and plot methods are provided, as
  well as the usual extractor methods like coefficients, residuals etc

* the method step.gam provides a flexible and customizable approach to
  model selection. 

Some differences with the Splus version of gam:

* predictions with new data are improved, without need for the
  "safe.predict.gam" function. This was partly facilitated by
  the improved prediction strategy used in R for GLMs and LMs

* Currently the only backfitting algorithm is all.wam. In the earlier
  versions of gam, dedicated fortran routines fit models that had only
  smoothing spline terms (s.wam) or all local regression terms
  (lo.wam), which in fact made calls back to Splus to update the
  working response and weights. These were designed for efficiency. It
  seems now with much faster computers this efficiency is no longer
  needed, and all.wam is modular and "visible"

 
This package is numbered 0.9 in anticipation of a few bug fixes and
glitches. I have tested many aspects of the functions, but there are
always a few that slip by. I will be happy to hear of any problems,
bugs and suggestions.

Plans for future versions:

* exact standard error calculations. gam employs approximations as
  described in the white book. With a bit more computing (now
  possible), we will have a function that computes exact standard
  errors along the lines described in the GAM book page 127.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0408111452280.15406-100000@zil.kom.auc.dk>

I have recently uploaded a new package to CRAN called eba,
which stands for elimination-by-aspects models.

It allows for fitting and testing probabilistic choice models,
especially the BTL model (Bradley & Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959),
elimination-by-aspects (EBA) models (Tversky, 1972), and
preference tree (Pretree) models (Tversky & Sattath, 1979).

I believe that the functions in this package can be useful
in many fields, like marketing, consumer research, psychological
scaling, and food testing, to name only a few.

Detailed information about probabilistic choice models and
how to fit them can be found in a recent publication:

Wickelmaier, F. & Schmid, C. (2004). A Matlab function to estimate
  choice model parameters from paired-comparison data. Behavior
  Research Methods, Instruments, and Computers, 36(1), 29-40.

I would be glad to receive some feedback or comments.

Message-ID: <20040812200147.3e098447.Achim.Zeileis@wu-wien.ac.at>

Dear useRs,

I used the summer months to work on all of my packages,
and so this is the first of a sequence of announcements
of "new" or updated packages. The "new" packages are new 
in the sense that previous versions had been on CRAN for
some months but hadn't been announced to the R community
via this list until now.

All packages are available from the CRAN master site
in source form - binary versions should be available
from the mirrors in the next days.


So the first announcement is for fortunes 1.0-3:

The fortunes package provides simple infrastructure for
reading fortunes from a .csv file and displaying them.
Furthermore, it contains a growing list of fortunes
related to R, mainly collected from the mailing lists
but also from quotes at conferences. The author list
contains me (as I've written the R code) as well as
the people who contributed quotes by sending me a mail.
The original "authors" of each quote are always given
in the respective fortune.

For those of you who want to see a quote each time they 
start up R: you can add to your .Rprofile something like

if(interactive()) { library(fortunes); fortune() }

If you want to create your own list of fortunes you can
simply add another fortune collection in .csv format.
Of course, it would also be great if you could contribute
some quotes to the package...simply send me an e-mail.

Enjoy!

Message-ID: <20040812200328.0c22c1d6.Achim.Zeileis@wu-wien.ac.at>

Dear useRs,

here is the announcement for the next "new" package:
sandwich 0.1-3.

sandwich provides heteroskedasticity (and autocorrelation)
consistent covariance matrix estimators (also called HC
and HAC estimators).

The former are implemented in the function vcovHC() (which
was available in strucchange  before - and independently
in hccm() in John Fox's car package).

And the latter are implemented in the function vcovHAC().
This implements sandwich-type estimators in a rather 
flexible way, allowing for user-defined weights or 
weight functions. It builds on some of the functionality
which was before available in Thomas Lumley's weave package
(not on CRAN). In particular it makes available the
class of WEAVE estimators introduced by Lumley & Heagerty (1999)
in the function weave() which is a convenience interface to
vcovHAC(). Furthermore, it implements the class of kernel
HAC estimators with automatic bandwidth-selection of
Andrews (1991) in the function kernHAC(), which is again a
convenience interface to vcovHAC().

Best wishes,
Z

Dear useRs,

yet another "new" package: zoo 0.2-0.

zoo provides a simple S3 class and methods for totally
ordered indexed observations such as irregular time
series. Although there are other packages for irregular
time series available on CRAN (Giles Heywood's its 
package and irts() in Adrian Trapletti's tseries package)
I wrote this package because I needed something which
provides simple infrastructure for observations with
(almost) arbitrary indexes (and not only "POSIXct" time
stampes as in its() and irts()). And it was at least also
useful for Gabor Grothendieck who provided most of the
updates to this version.

Best wishes,

The most significant additions were two functions gefp()
and efpFunctional().

gefp() implements a class of generalized M-fluctuation
tests for testing for parameter instability or structural
change in general parametric models including generalized
linear models (GLMs). 

efpFunctional() provides infrastructure for inference based
on functionals applied to empirical fluctuation processes
such as automatic tabulation of critical values and a choice
of a suitable visualization method.

The theory behind both functions is described in Zeileis
& Hornik (2003), the implementation ideas are explained in
Zeileis (2004). Links to both papers are available from
my web page: http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~zeileis/

Date: 2004-08-10
Title: Testing for Structural Change
Author: Achim Zeileis, Friedrich Leisch, Bruce Hansen,

Maintainer: Achim Zeileis <Achim.Zeileis at wu-wien.ac.at>
Description: Testing, dating and monitoring of structural change in
             linear regression relationships.
             strucchange features tests/methods from the generalized
             fluctuation test framework as well as from the F test (Chow
             test) framework. This includes methods to fit, plot and
             test fluctuation processes (e.g., CUSUM, MOSUM,
             recursive/moving estimates) and F statistics, respectively.
             It is possible to monitor incoming data online using
             fluctuation processes.
             Finally, the breakpoints in regression models with
             structural changes can be estimated together with
             confidence intervals. Emphasis is always given to methods
             for visualizing the data.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0409151632150.17035-100000@gannet.stats>

The first non-maintenance update of RODBC since January 2003 is now on 
CRAN and will soon propagate to mirrors.  From the ChangeLog:

        * Select the decimal point from Sys.localeconv.

        * Add an external reference and finalizer so open channels get
          closed at the end of the session or when there is no R object
          referring to them.

        * There is no longer a restriction to 16 channels.

        * Add NAMESPACE.

        * odbcConnect{Access,Dbase,Excel} allow a missing file name
          (and will bring up a dialog box to search for it).

        * odbcGetInfo returns more information in a 8-element character
          vector (based on an idea of Matthew Dowle).

        * The C code calls SQLExecuteDirect rather than SQLExecute and
          does not call SQLCloseCursor, based on a problem report from
          Matthew Dowle using MS SQLServer.  Repeated calls to
          sqlGetResults now work.

        * New function sqlFetchMore.

        * Table names in Access with embedded spaces are mapped to the
          [name space] form which Access requires.

        * Table creation no longer removes _ from column names.

        * New functions get/setSqlTypeInfo and the typeInfo argument to
          sqlSave allow users to specify the mapping from R types to DBMS
          datatypes.  sqlSave also allows the specification of DBMS
          datatypes by column.

        * It is now possible to write more than 255 chars to a field with
          sqlSave and sqlUpdate.

        * Dates and timestamps are now read as 'Date' and 'POSIXct'
          columns by sqlGetResults (unless as.is = TRUE for the column).

I have been able to test SQL Server reasonably extensively this time 
around, as well as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Access, Excel and SQLite.

Parallel programming with snowFT

Our package snowFT is now available at CRAN. It is an extention of the
package snow, which adds fault tolerance (in the sense of recomputing
computational units when hardware/network failures occur on compute
nodes) and a tighter notion of reproducibility for computations
running on clusters.  It additionally provides tools for flexible
management of cluster size as well as computation transparency.

snowFT is written by Hana Sevcikova and Tony Rossini.

(this tool currently requires rpvm for the SNOW backend, though we are
exploring the possibility of extensions for the Rmpi backend.  It is
unlikely that these extensions will be implemented for the socket
backend.

	Announcing Rpad, a web-based workbook-style interface for R
Message-ID: <414B35AC.1030201@epri-peac.com>


Rpad is an interactive, web-based analysis system. Rpad pages are
interactive workbook-type sheets based on R. Rpad is an analysis package, a
web-page designer, and a gui designer all wrapped in one. Rpad pages are 
run from the browser and connect to R running on the server (the same 
server that hosts the web pages).

Rpad includes the R package "RpadUtils", which adds convenient code to
generate HTML widgets and convenience functions for generating web graphics
(png).

For more information and demonstrations, please see:

http://www.Rpad.org/Rpad/

Key features include:

(*) WYSIWYG editing -- The browser page is editable, so you can add 
comments or change the code or input data.

(*) GUI's -- Create GUI elements with R or with the Rpad interface.

(*) Fast -- No browser refreshes. The R process on the server stays alive 
while the browser page is open, so once the page is up and running, it is 
quite responsive.

(*) HTML output -- Create fancy HTML output using Eric Lecoutre's R2HTML.

(*) Simple plotting -- Has convenience functions to simplify creation and
presentation of web-friendly graphics.

(*) Flexible -- You can add features in a number of ways with javascript
and/or R.

(*) Cross platform -- Rpad pages work in Internet Explorer v5.5 or greater
and Mozilla (Firefox or Suite). The server-side code works in Apache in
Linux or Windows (although not as well in Windows).

(*) Open source -- Rpad brings together several powerful open-source
technologies, specifically: R, Mozile, HTMLArea, Statistics-R-0.02,
JSCookMenu, Apache, and R2HTML.

Feel free to use the r-sig-gui mailing list
(https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-gui) for any feedback on Rpad, 
the demonstration pages, and especially for feedback and questions on
installing your own Rpad server.

Dear all,

I have just uploaded a package to CRAN a new package called 'adehabitat'.
This package is intended for ecologists who want to analyse the use of 
space by animals.
Many functions currently used in this field are available to
highlight habitat selection by animals (selection ratios, ENFA, habitat 
suitability maps
with the algorithm DOMAIN or Resource Selection Functions)
or to describe the movements and area used in radio-tracking studies 
(kernel or
minimum convex polygon home range, computation of travel speed and turning 
angles).
ASCII raster maps exported from Arcview can also be imported, and basic GIS 
operations
are available (e.g. spatial join, computation of buffers).

The package comes with a pdf documentation file which
contains an overview of the main classes of maps available
in the package.

Questions, comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Here is the description file of the package:

Subject: [R-pkgs] new version of package "distr" available
Message-ID: <41586016.7060705@uni-bayreuth.de>

We would like to announce the availability on CRAN of a new version (1.4)
of our package "distr" .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from 1.3 to 1.4
-To avoid name collisions with short forms for TRUE and FALSE: classes T
 and F (T- and F-distributions) renamed to Td and Fd
-The package is now loaded as a binary => considerable speed gain
-Using subsititute, the bodies of the r,d,p,q-function-slots
 distributions show the parameter values with which they were 
 generated
-Convolutions and applications of the math group may now be traced in
 r-slot of a distribution object, compare
              r(sin(Norm()) + cos(Unif() * 3 + 2))
-Parameters of a distribution (mean, sd, etc) are now tested on length 1
  *we see the objects as implementations of univariate distributions, so
   vectors  make  no sense here; rather one could gather several objects 
   with possibly different parameters to a vector of distributions.
   Of course, the original R-functions rnorm etc remain unchanged and
   still allow for vector-valued parameters.
  *
-Classes "Parameter" , "Distribution" , "UnivariateDistribution" are no
 longer VIRTUAL
-"AbscontParameter" and "DiscreteParameter" are replaced by "Parameter"
-Type of slots d,p,q  and param is changed to "OptionalFunction" and
 "OptionalParameter" respectively

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Description of "distr":
"distr" is to provide a conceptual treatment of random variables
(r.v.'s) by means of S4--classes. A virtual mother class "Distribution" 
is introduced.
All distributions of the "base" package are implemented as subclasses of
either "AbscontDistribution" or "DiscreteDistribution".

Using these classes, we also provide (default) methods to automatically
generate the image distributions under unary mathematical operations as
well as a general convolution algorithm.

Additionally, we also provide classes for a standardized treatment of
simulations (also under contaminations) and evaluations of statistical
procedures on such simulations.

gregmisc 2.0.0
===========

gregmisc 2.0.0 has been released and is now available on CRAN.   

Important Changes
---------------------------

- Now a package bundle 

For this release, gregmisc has been split into a bundle containing 4
separate packages: gdata, gmodels, gplots and gtools. All of your favorite
functions are still present, but they are now better organized into thematic
groups, which should make them easier to maintain.

- Namespaces

Each of the gregmisc packages now provide namespaces, and are fully
compatible with R 2.0.0.   The namespaces make it easier to avoid conflicts
with functions in other packages, and prevent local utility functions from
cluttering up the global function namespace.

Consequences for Users
------------------------------------

Instead of attaching the gregmisc package, you will need to attach the
appropriate individual packages.  IE, instead of
	> library(gregmisc)
you should use one or more of
	> library(gdata)
	> library(gmodels)
	> library(gplots)
	> library(gtools)

For more details, including bug fixes, see the ChangeLog file in the source
distribution.

Subject: [R-pkgs] updated package boolean 1.5
Message-ID: <FBBB9805-18C2-11D9-A4F9-000A95A672D6@fas.harvard.edu>


I have just uploaded an updated version of my boolean package (v1.05), 
which should be propagating through CRAN's mirrors soon.  Boolean 
permits estimation of Boolean logit and probit models (see Braumoeller 
(2003), full reference in help file, for derivation).  Boolean logit 
and probit are a family of partial-observability n-variate models 
designed to permit researchers to model causal complexity, or multiple 
causal "paths" to a given outcome.  The various "paths" are modeled as 
latent dependent variables that are multiplied together in a manner 
determined by the logic of their (Boolean) interaction.  Any 
combination of ANDs and ORs can be posited, and the interaction of any 
number of latent dependent variables can be modeled, although the 
procedure becomes exponentially more data-intensive as the number of 
latent dependent variables increases.

The update to version 1.04 was not announced; only minor modifications 
were made to ensure compatibility with R 1.9.

The update to version 1.05 permits the use of Sekhon and Mebane's 
GENOUD optimizer for likelihood surfaces that are convoluted and 
therefore contain multiple local maxima.  Because this procedure can 
produce such surfaces quite easily, the use of GENOUD is recommended.

For R 2.0.0, I had to rewrite some parts of the code so that it works. I 
did that quickly (maybe too), letting some bugs.

Now, this is mere the good R 2.0 version, with some new functionalities:

- HTML.matrix and HTML.data.frame now can use several new output options
   as they call now 'format. This allows using a comma "," as decimal
   separator for example. All 'format' arguments are allowed and can be used
   as a single element (value applies to all columns) or a vector (provide
   values for each column). - Suggestion by Arne Henningsen

- HTML.data.frame now has a sortableDF option. When using it, a link to
   an external DHTML behavior file is done (suggestion by Tom Short, could be
   used by it's wonderful Rpad)

- Available options that user may want to change
  (default for every   matrix/DF):
	R2HTML.sortableDF  		(FALSE)
	R2HTML.format.digits  		(2)
	R2HTML.format.nsmall  		(0)
	R2HTML.format.big.mark		("")
	R2HTML.format.big.interval	(3)
	R2HTML.format.decimal.mark=	(Sys.localeconv()[["decimal_point"]])

- Bug fixed: HTML.table

Following modifications contributed by Philippe Grosjean

- Now uses NAMESPACE

- Renamed .First.lib() into .onLoad()

- In RweaveHTMLSetup(), commented if(!require(R2HTML))
       stop("R2HTML package is required.").
   This is not useful, becasue this function IS in R2HTML package!!!

- Changed utils:::XXX and utils::XXX into XXX everywhere, and added
   import(utils) in NAMESPACE instead.

Dear useRs,

FlexMix version 1.0-0 has been released on CRAN. FlexMix implements a
general framework for finite mixtures of regression models using the
EM algorithm.  FlexMix provides the E-step and all data handling,
while the M-step can be supplied by the user to easily define new
models. Existing drivers implement mixtures of standard linear models,
generalized linear models and model-based clustering.

Compared to the porvious version on CRAN the code has not changed, but
the package has now an introductionary vignette, see

	vignette("flexmix-intro")

after installing the package. The vignette has also been published in
the Journal of Statistical Software, see http://www.jstatsoft.org.

Message-ID: <16761.17686.677020.587408@ls01.fas.harvard.edu>


"Matching" version 0.48 is now available on CRAN.

Matching provides functions for estimating causal effects by
multivariate and propensity score matching. The package includes a
variety of univariate and multivariate tests to determine if balance
has been obtained by the matching procedure. These tests can also be
used to determine if an experiment or quasi-experiment is balanced on
baseline covariates.  The functions provide valid standard errors and
allow one to estimate various estimands.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0410281558340.3752-100000@gannet.stats>

There is an update for the `foreign' package now on the CRAN master and 
soon on a mirror near you.

This adds support for

DBF files (by Nicholas Lewin-Koh, Roger Bivand and myself)
Systat files written on MS-DOS/Windows (by Roger Bivand)

The reasons for announcing this update are

1) People quite often ask for DBF support.

2) There is a `maptools' update that depends on getting this one.

3) We have tested many Systat and DBF files, and even created some extreme
examples of our own.  But many applications write DBF files and inevitably
there are rogue files out there, so we would appreciate seeing examples
that either do not work as expected or crash R.

The `R Data Import/Export' manual in R-patched and R-devel has been 
revised to cover the new functionality.

This is an update (version 1.2), not a new package, but given recent 
postings on the R lists an announcement may be helpful.

The 'dichromat' package has color schemes designed for people with 
red-green deficient or anomalous vision, tools for simulating the effect 
of color blindness, and tools for creating color ramps and palettes (these 
last will be in R 2.1.0).

I would welcome feedback on the accuracy of the simulations of color 
blindness from people who are actually affected. They are based on 
published algorithms and methods, but color matching is always tricky.

Message-ID: <a06200710bdc39dd2eba3@[139.166.242.29]>

Dear list

R package "gsl" is now on  CRAN.  This  is a wrapper for
the special functions of the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL).  Functions include
elliptic integrals, Airy functions, hypergeometric functions, and so on.
Most functions optionally return error estimates.

This library is a little odd in that documentation is limited to a 
pointer to the GSL reference
manual, and occasional re-productions of tables and figures from 
Abramowitz and Stegun.

It passes R CMD check  under Fedora Linux, and MacOSX 10.3 if the GSL
(version 1.5)  is installed in the default locations.

A windows version is available at  http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/RWin/2.0.0/

Subject: [R-pkgs] New Hmisc Package Available
Message-ID: <41ACF14A.5030803@vanderbilt.edu>

An updated version of Hmisc is now available from CRAN.  The Web site 
for Hmisc is http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/s/Hmisc.  The change log 
may be found at http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/changelog/Hmisc.html. 
Changes made after 2004-11-24 should be ignored; these will be in the 
next version.

The most major change in Hmisc is that thanks to discussions with a 
highly respected, persistent, and convincing member of the R community, 
Hmisc no longer overrides [.factor to drop unused factor levels by 
default upon subsetting.  You can get the old behavior at any time by 
typing dropUnusedLevels().  A message to that effect appears when you 
attach the package.  Also Hmisc no longer overrides the interaction 
function, as the R builtin version provides the sep argument.  In the 
next version, the summary.formula function will be updated to 
automatically drop unused levels when this is appropriate.

Some other key changes are the addition of bubble plot capability in 
xYplot and addition of the capability of csv.get to correct certain date 
formatting inconsistencies.  sasxport.get now has keep and drop 
arguments to restrict attention to a subset of datasets when many 
datasets are being imported.  Other changes include bug and 
documentation fixes.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Quantian 0.6.9.2 with over 500 CRAN / BioC packages
Message-ID: <20041202044055.GA13834@sonny.eddelbuettel.com>

I posted the following a little earlier on the quantian-announce list -- but
it may be of interest here as well as this version contains all (but three,
see below) packages from CRAN, and all of BioConductor.

Quantian strives to provide the easiest way to set up a very complete
scientific computing environment with a wide variety of tools -- including
R, ESS, Ggobi, almost all of CRAN, all of BioConductor, as well as openMosix
support, and many more applications -- in minutes from a bootable dvd.

Feedback is always welcome, in particular on how to communicate more
directly with specific communities which may benefit from Quantian.  

Dirk



(Please see note [1] below regarding recipients for this posting. Thanks!)


Executive Summary: 

    Quantian 0.6.9.2 extends the Quantian series based on Knoppix 3.6 and the
    corresponding clusterKnoppix release. Over 475 new packages from CRAN and
    BioConductor provide unparalleled support for statistical computing, data
    analysis and graphical methods via the R environment and language.
    Several new packages have been added, and numerous other packages have
    been updated as well.


Announcing Quantian release 0.6.9.2
===================================


I   What is it?

    Quantian is a remastering of Knoppix, the self-configuring and directly
    bootable cdrom/dvd that turns any pc or laptop into a full-featured Linux
    workstation, and clusterKnoppix, which adds support for openMosix-based 
    cluster computing. However, Quantian differs from (cluster)Knoppix by
    adding a very large set of programs of interest to applied or theoretical
    workers in quantitative or data-driven fields. 

    See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian.html for more details.

    
II  What is new?

    o Second release based on Knoppix 3.6 adding 
        - over 500 R packages from CRAN and BioConductor (see next point)
        - several new packages such as labplot, python-matplotlib,
          python-gdal, subversion, tla, dia, ...
        - several packages with newer upstream versions such as R 2.0.1, gretl 1.3.0,
        - added most Recommended: packages for already installed packages
 
    o The main new feature is the unique support for almost all packages from
        - CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org), and 
        - BioConductor (http://www.bioconductor.org)
      About 60 packages are installed directly as Debian packages, and 478
      more are installed directly into /usr/local/lib/R/site-packages using
      the mechanisms provided by R, CRAN and BioConductor (and as such, these
      packages will not appear in the Debian package list).  
      The only missing CRAN packages are mimR (windows-only), ROracle
      (requires Oracle) and seao.gui which didn't build in batch mode.
      
    o Adding the Recommended: packages provides additional documentation, 
      as well as header files, which complements the installed packages.
     
    o Total size is 2.0 gb for the compressed iso image corresponding to
      almost 6 gb of uncompressed software. 

    o See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/changelog.html for details.

    o See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/howto.html for several
      short HOWTOs on booting Quantian from hd on either Windows or Linux,
      booting via a bootcd (such as clusterKnoppix), or botting from a 
      USB memory device.  Contributions, corrections, and feedback on these
      HOWTOs is always appreciated.


III Where do I get it?

    o Downloads are available from the main hosts already listed above, i.e.
      on the West Coast at

            http://www.analytics.washington.edu/downloads/quantian/

      and at the East Coast at

            http://research.warnes.net/downloads/quantian/CURRENT/
	    ftp://research.warnes.net/users/edd/quantian/CURRENT/

      The most recent release is also available at

            http://quantian.alioth.debian.org/

    o Bittorrents are available via

            http://www.analytics.washington.edu:6969/

    o The main European mirror has already caught up:

            http://sunsite.rediris.es/mirror/quantian

      and the second Sunsite mirror should hopefully catch up soon:

            http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/ftp/pub/Linux/quantian

    o CD/DVD vendors will probably update their offerings soon as well. 
      BudgetLinuxCDs.com is typically the fastest:

            http://www.budgetlinuxcds.com/index.php?page=Choose&letter=Q&sort=upd

      and CheapBytes should follow shortly:

            http://www.cheapbytes.com

      Pointers to other vendors are always appreciated.


IV  Mailing lists

    o Two mailing lists exist for Quantian

        quantian-announce	  for announcements, intended to be low volume
        quantian-general	  for general discussions about Quantian

      available via

        http://alioth.debian.org/mail/?group_id=1425

      for subscription info etc., and start using the quantian-general lists
      for general questions, comments, suggestions or discussions about 
      Quantian.

      Quantian-general is subscribed to quantian-announce, so you only need
      to subscribe to one (but can of course subscribe to both).

      Reply-To: for this message is quantian-general at lists.alioth.debian.org
      so that discussions can be continued on the list.


V  Known Bugs

    o Sound does not appear to get configured on my laptops.


VI   Other items

    o Feedback / poll on package additions or removal

      As always, I welcome comments and suggestions about programs to be
      added or removed. Existing Debian packages get pushed to the front of
      the line.

      Please send feedback, questions, comments, ... to the 
      
	quantian-general at lists.alioth.debian.org

      list to maximise the number of eyes glancing at any one question.

    o Feedback would also be appreciated on ways to better communicate with
      difference scientific communities that could be interested in Quantian.


VII Notes

    [1] This email is sent via the quantian-announce mailing list. I have
        subscribed those whose email addresses are in my quantian mail folder 
        due to prior emails. The quantian-announce mailing list only sends
        moderator-approved posts -- so there should be no spam whatsoever. I 
        also added LWN and DWN who had run previous announcements, and as 
        suggested, the openmosix-general, clusterknoppix and debian-knoppix 
        lists. Anybody who considers this unwanted is kindly asked to send me
        a private mail to get unsubscribed immediately.

Dear list members,

I've uploaded a new package, called polycor (version 0.5-0), to CRAN. The
package has functions for computing polychoric and polyserial correlations,
either by maximum-likelihood (in which case, standard errors are available)
or by faster approximations. There's also a function to compute
"heterogeneous" correlation matrices composed of product-moment, polychoric,
and polyserial correlations, as appropriate to each pair of variables.

Comments and suggestions would be appreciated.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0412231329140.23821@thorin.ci.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear useRs,

a new and much improved version of the zoo package for indexed totally
ordered observations (such as irregular time series) is available from
CRAN. It allows indexing observations with time/index vectors of arbitrary
class and extends many of the standard generic functions also available
for "ts" objects. Additionally, it allows conversion from/to other
(irregular) time series classes such as "its" and "irts". A vignette that
explains the features of zoo is also available in the package. For further
details see also the list of changes below.

Seasonal greetings,
Z


Changes in Version 0.9-1

  o new generic functions ORDER() and MATCH() (with
    order() and match() as the default) so that zoo()
    can handle  arbitrary index/time classes when
    suitable methods for the generic function c(),
    length(), order(), match() and subsetting [, are
    supplied.

  o improved printing of "zoo" objects and added
    a summary() method.

  o extended coercion functionality to and from
    "zoo" objects. "its" objects can be coerced to
    "zoo" and vice versa. "zoo" objects can be
    coerced to vector, matrix, data.frame or list.

  o added functionality to extract/assign to
    the coredata() of a "zoo" object.

  o added/improved functionality to extract/assign
    to the window() of a "zoo" object.

  o added/improved functionality to extract/assign
    to the index() or time() of a "zoo" object.

  o added lag(), diff(), start(), end(), head(),
    tail() methods.

  o improved plot.zoo() by more flexible expansion
    of plotting parameters such as col, lty and pch.

  o added a cbind() method for "zoo" objects (almost
    synonymous with merge())

  o NA handling for "zoo" objects via na.omit(),
    na.contiguous(), na.approx() and na.locf().

  o na.locf() generic function with default method (suitable
    for "zoo" objects) which implements Last Observation
    Carried Forward.

  o na.approx() generic function with default method (suitable
    for "zoo" objects) which implements elimination of NAs
    by interpolation.

  o added mathematical methods: group generic functions
    for "zoo" objects, t(), cumsum(), cumprod(), cummin(),
    and cummax().

  o added model.frame.AsIs and model.frame.zoo to support
    regression based on zoo objects, in particular with lm()
    (but also many other regression functions).

  o Zero length vector zoo objects may have non-zero index vectors
    intended to be used in merge to extend zoo objects. zoo
    changed to enable the creation of such objects by omitting
    first argument.

  o added a vignette explaining the new features
