Dear all,

After being archived on CRAN on 2023-10-1, hydroTSM is finally back on CRAN
since January 18th: https://cran.r-project.org/package=hydroTSM.

This new version 0.7-0 has several new functions, improvements, bugfixes,
and a new dataset, mostly devoted to work with sub-daily and sub-hourly
time series.

*) New functions: baseflow, plot_pq, calendarHeatmap, subhourly2hourly,
subhourly2nminutes, daily2weekly, subdaily2weekly, cmv, si.

*) Improvements: climograph, (sub)daily2monthly, subdaily2daily,
daily2annual, daily2monthly, subdaily2annual, hip, hydroplot, sname2plot,
izoo2rzoo.

A detailed description of the previous changes can be found in the new
News.md file:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hydroTSM/news/news.html

Two vignettes illustrate the usage of the some of the main functions:

1) Analysis of daily precipitation data:
https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/hydroTSM/vignettes/hydroTSM_Daily_P_Vignette-knitr.pdf

2) 1) Analysis of daily streamflow data:

Message-ID: <CAJ44-Amtui+ZZCtM4JRMMLJW3d3EkUkBkbVx=b=epWep9v_C=A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

After being archived on CRAN on  2023-10-16 , hydroGOF is finally back on
CRAN since January 21th: https://cran.r-project.org/package=hydroGOF.

This new version 0.5-4 includes:

*) the following new functions:

    -) KGElf (Garc?a et al., 2017),
    -) sKGE (Fowler et al., 2018),
    -) KGEnp (Pool et al., 2018),
    -) dr (Willmott et al., 2012),
    -) ubRMSE (Entekhabi et al., 2010),
    -) wNSE (Hundecha and Bardossy, 2004),
    -) rSpearman,
    -) R2

*) improvements: all the functions allow you to apply a user-defined
function (e.g., log, sqrt) to both 'sim' and 'obs' before computing the
goodness-of-fit measure.

A detailed description of the previous changes can be found for the 0.5-0
version in the new News.md file:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hydroGOF/news/news.html

A much improved vignette illustrate the usage of some of the main functions:

*) Analysis of daily precipitation data:
https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/hydroGOF/vignettes/hydroGOF_Vignette.pdf

Subject: [R-pkgs] clusterMI: Cluster Analysis with Missing Values by
 Multiple Imputation
Message-ID: <bb40a01d-a3dc-4b58-88d5-01f7eb4d4517@cnam.fr>

Dear all,

I am pleased to announce the release of a new package named 'clusterMI' on CRAN.

clusterMI allows clustering of incomplete observations by addressing missing values using multiple imputation.

For achieving this goal, the methodology consists in three steps:

1. missing data imputation using tailored imputation models: four multiple imputation methods are proposed, two are based on joint modelling (JM-GL and JM-DP) and two are fully sequential methods (FCS-homo and FCS-hetero).
2. cluster analysis of imputed data sets: six clustering methods are available (kmeans, pam, clara, hierarchical clustering, fuzzy c-means and gaussian mixture), but custom methods can also be easily used.
3. partition pooling: the set of partitions is aggregated using NMF based method. An associated instability measure is computed by bootstrap. Among applications, this instability measure can be used to choose a number of clusters with missing values.

The package also offers several diagnostic tools for tuning the number of imputed data sets, for checking convergence in sequential imputation, for checking the fit of imputation models, etc.

This is the first version of the package, your feedback and suggestions are welcome!

Please find more details and download the package from the following link:https://cran.r-project.org/package=clusterMI

Best regards,

V. Audigier

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package - fastTS
Message-ID: <SJ2PR05MB10332B2BBCA79839072290B63DB3B2@SJ2PR05MB10332.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hi R enthusiasts,

I am happy to announce a new package available on CRAN: fastTS (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fastTS/). fastTS is especially useful for large time series with exogenous features and/or complex seasonality (i.e. with multiple modes), allowing for possibly high-dimensional feature sets. The method can also facilitate inference on exogenous features, conditional on a series' autoregressive structure. The regularization-based method is considerably faster than competitors, while often producing more accurate predictions. See our open-access publication for more information: https://doi.org/10.1177/1471082X231225307

The package has several vignettes, one of which is an detailed walkthrough of an application to an (included) data set consisting of an hourly series of arrivals into the University of Iowa Emergency Department with concurrent local temperature.

If you encounter any issues or would like to make contributions, please do so via the package's GitHub page: https://github.com/petersonR/fastTS

Best,
Ryan
