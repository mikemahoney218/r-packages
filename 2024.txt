Dear all,

After being archived on CRAN on 2023-10-1, hydroTSM is finally back on CRAN
since January 18th: https://cran.r-project.org/package=hydroTSM.

This new version 0.7-0 has several new functions, improvements, bugfixes,
and a new dataset, mostly devoted to work with sub-daily and sub-hourly
time series.

*) New functions: baseflow, plot_pq, calendarHeatmap, subhourly2hourly,
subhourly2nminutes, daily2weekly, subdaily2weekly, cmv, si.

*) Improvements: climograph, (sub)daily2monthly, subdaily2daily,
daily2annual, daily2monthly, subdaily2annual, hip, hydroplot, sname2plot,
izoo2rzoo.

A detailed description of the previous changes can be found in the new
News.md file:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hydroTSM/news/news.html

Two vignettes illustrate the usage of the some of the main functions:

1) Analysis of daily precipitation data:

Dear all,

After being archived on CRAN on  2023-10-16 , hydroGOF is finally back on
CRAN since January 21th: https://cran.r-project.org/package=hydroGOF.

This new version 0.5-4 includes:

*) the following new functions:

    -) KGElf (Garc?a et al., 2017),

    -) wNSE (Hundecha and Bardossy, 2004),
    -) rSpearman,
    -) R2

*) improvements: all the functions allow you to apply a user-defined
function (e.g., log, sqrt) to both 'sim' and 'obs' before computing the
goodness-of-fit measure.

version in the new News.md file:
