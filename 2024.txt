Subject: [R-pkgs] clusterMI: Cluster Analysis with Missing Values by
 Multiple Imputation
Message-ID: <bb40a01d-a3dc-4b58-88d5-01f7eb4d4517@cnam.fr>

Dear all,

I am pleased to announce the release of a new package named 'clusterMI' on CRAN.

clusterMI allows clustering of incomplete observations by addressing missing values using multiple imputation.

For achieving this goal, the methodology consists in three steps:

1. missing data imputation using tailored imputation models: four multiple imputation methods are proposed, two are based on joint modelling (JM-GL and JM-DP) and two are fully sequential methods (FCS-homo and FCS-hetero).
2. cluster analysis of imputed data sets: six clustering methods are available (kmeans, pam, clara, hierarchical clustering, fuzzy c-means and gaussian mixture), but custom methods can also be easily used.
3. partition pooling: the set of partitions is aggregated using NMF based method. An associated instability measure is computed by bootstrap. Among applications, this instability measure can be used to choose a number of clusters with missing values.

The package also offers several diagnostic tools for tuning the number of imputed data sets, for checking convergence in sequential imputation, for checking the fit of imputation models, etc.

This is the first version of the package, your feedback and suggestions are welcome!

Please find more details and download the package from the following link:https://cran.r-project.org/package=clusterMI

Best regards,

V. Audigier

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package - fastTS
Message-ID: <SJ2PR05MB10332B2BBCA79839072290B63DB3B2@SJ2PR05MB10332.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hi R enthusiasts,

I am happy to announce a new package available on CRAN: fastTS (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fastTS/). fastTS is especially useful for large time series with exogenous features and/or complex seasonality (i.e. with multiple modes), allowing for possibly high-dimensional feature sets. The method can also facilitate inference on exogenous features, conditional on a series' autoregressive structure. The regularization-based method is considerably faster than competitors, while often producing more accurate predictions. See our open-access publication for more information: https://doi.org/10.1177/1471082X231225307

The package has several vignettes, one of which is an detailed walkthrough of an application to an (included) data set consisting of an hourly series of arrivals into the University of Iowa Emergency Department with concurrent local temperature.

If you encounter any issues or would like to make contributions, please do so via the package's GitHub page: https://github.com/petersonR/fastTS

Best,
Ryan

Subject: [R-pkgs] segmented 2.1-0 is released
Message-ID: <dbad3dff-1d81-4439-9f1f-e33daafcc9d0@unipa.it>

dear R users,
I am pleased to announce that segmented 2.1-0 is now available on CRAN.

segmented focuses on estimation of breakpoints/changepoints of 
segmented, i.e. piecewise linear, relationships in (generalized) linear 
models. Starting with version 2.0-0, it is also possible to model 
stepmented, i.e. piecewise constant, effects.

In the last release both models may be fitted via a formula interface, 
such as

segreg(y ~ seg(x1, npsi=2) + seg(x2) + z)

stepreg(y ~ seg(x1, npsi=2) + seg(x2) +seg(x3, npsi=3) + z, family=poisson)

There is virtually no limit in the number of covariates and 
corresponding number of changepoints to be estimated.

thank you,
kind regards,
Vito

Subject: [R-pkgs] QGA 1.0 is released
Message-ID: <7ce4d41b-92e3-435c-a9e8-2e238f74c52e@gmail.com>

Dear R users,

I am pleased to announce that QGA 1.0 is now available on CRAN.

QGA implements the Quantum Genetic Algorithm, as proposed by Han and Kim 
in 2000, and is an R implementation derived from the Python one by 
Lahoz-Beltra in 2016.

Under this approach, each solution is represented as a sequence of 
(qu)bits. Simulating the quantum paradigm, these qubits are in a 
superposition state: when measuring them, they collapse in a 0 or 1 
state. After measurement, the solution's fitness is calculated as in 
usual genetic algorithms.

The evolution at each iteration is oriented by the application of two 
quantum gates to the amplitudes of the qubits: (1) a rotation gate 
(always); (2) a Pauli-X gate (optionally). The rotation is based on the 
theta angle values: higher values allow a quicker evolution, and lower 
values avoid local maxima. The Pauli-X gate is equivalent to the 
classical mutation operator and determines the swap between alfa and 
beta amplitudes of a given qubit.

The package has been developed in such a way as to permit a complete 
separation between the 'engine', and the particular problem subject to 
combinatorial optimization. This is evident in the available examples, 
that come with the package, illustrating the application of QGA to 
different problems: knapsack, traveler salesman, and clustering.

Thank you, kind regards,

Giulio Barcaroli

Dear R Users,

I am pleased to announce that Goodreader 0.1.1 is now available on CRAN.

Goodreader offers a toolkit for scraping and analyzing book data from
Goodreads. Users can search for books, scrape detailed information and
reviews, perform sentiment analysis on reviews, and conduct topic modeling.

Here?s a quick overview of how to use Goodreader:
# Search for books
AI_df <- search_goodreads(search_term = "artificial intelligence",
search_in = "title", num_books = 10, sort_by = "ratings")

# Retrieve Book IDs and save them to a text file
get_book_ids(input_data = AI_df, file_name = "AI_books.txt")

# Get book-related information
scrape_books(book_ids_path = "AI_books.txt")

# Scrape book reviews
scrape_reviews(book_ids_path = "AI_books.txt", num_reviews = 10)

For more details, please visit: https://liu-chao.site/Goodreader/

Best regards,

Chao Liu

Subject: [R-pkgs] bit, bit64, ff and greeNsort
Message-ID: <b11255da-dd8d-4731-8b3c-0e8a2bdab5e0@truecluster.com>

Dear package maintainers,

Dear users of packages `bit`, `bit64`, `ff`,

Everyone interested in sustainable sorting algorithms,

I submitted updated versions for the upcoming R 4.5.0. The are only 
minor changes (see the NEWS files) but there is one important change in 
bit64:

 ??? o setting options(integer64_semantics="new")
 ????? gives the better semantics suggested by Ofek Shilon.
 ????? Downstream package authors: please test and adjust to the new 
semantics,
 ????? we plan to make that the default.

After 25 years volunteer work for the R community, that was my last 
combined submission for packages `bit`, `bit64` and `ff`.

I learned S+ in 1996 and supported R's 1.0 release in 2000 with bug 
testing, a small code contribution to `pairs` and motivating the 
core-team to replace 'NA' with NA_character_.

In 2007 Daniel Adler and I published `ff`: the first R package allowing 
big out of memory data.frames was a nail in the coffin of SAS dominance 
and helped R into the big data era.

2009 and 2012 followed `bit`, `bit64` to enhance R's data types somewhat 
with `bit` vectors and signed `integer64`. Package `bit` supported 
efficient selection in `ff`. Package `bit64` was an emergency 
development in order to establish rather `integer64' than another 
`int64` package that had too expensive performance.

Since 2011 I work for an employer that does not use R, and maintenance 
of R packages is a little rewarded burden.

Since 2010 my priorities shifted to fighting global heating by 
developing more sustainable sorting algorithms that provide better 
trade-offs between memory investments, compute costs and adaptivity to 
easier input patterns. My R&D project was successfully completed 2024 
with theory and design of new symmetric sorting algorithms that can 
replace Quicksort, Mergesort and Timsort. Lots of info at greeNsort.org. 
I have an R package `greeNsort` on github with a research testbed that 
can measure RAM, CPU and RAPL energy for ?150 equally tuned sorting 
algorithms on multiple test patterns.

Since 24.2.2022 my priorities are on strengthening resilience of 
European civil society.

Hence I happily accept the generous offer of Michael Chirico to carry 
forward the maintenance of packages `bit` and `bit64`. Please support 
him in the difficult task of developing very close to the core as a 
normal package author.

I will continue bug-fixing `ff` as time permits, although a modern C++ 
rewrite would be preferable, which

1) supports long vectors

2) avoids copying between Mapped Memory and R's memory

3) simplifies the package, particularly removes the "virtual window" 
complexity

All the best


Jens Oehlschl?gel
