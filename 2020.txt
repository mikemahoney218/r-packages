 Linear Regression Models
Message-ID: <CAG25rBLnG23LFt_m2KP5d5TAEonZBJZZM16Ai5Qz5Br8G6rAZw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I would like to introduce the above-named new package that is now available
on CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/skedastic/index.html The
package features numerous 'classical' heteroskedasticity tests (some not
previously available in any published R package) as well as one very new
test that appeared in the literature only in 2019.

Feedback on bugs/issues is most welcome at
https://github.com/tjfarrar/skedastic and reviews are welcome at
crantastic: https://crantastic.org/packages/skedastic

Sincerely,
Thomas Farrar

Subject: [R-pkgs] forestError 0.1.0: Random forest conditional prediction
 intervals, squared errors, and biases
Message-ID: <CAFbfGPa1mNBzw40kui_pD=CWSkFMeRiZ4551kg8ZcbKzdhfDvg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I?m writing to introduce a new package, forestError. This package estimates
conditional response quantiles (prediction intervals), conditional mean
squared prediction errors, conditional biases, and conditional prediction
error distribution functions for random forests using new methods proposed
in Lu and Hardin (2019+) <arXiv:1912.07435>.

The package does not grow specially designed random forests, but rather
sits on top of the standard random forest algorithm. In particular, the
package can estimate the above quantities for regression random forests
built using the randomForest, randomForestSRC, ranger, and quantregForest
packages.

I hope that you find this useful. Please feel free to reach out with
feedback or questions.

Hi all,


We?re happy to announce that the new version of *SWIM* is available on
CRAN. *SWIM* is an efficient sensitivity analysis tool for stochastic
models based on Monte Carlo samples. It provides weights on simulated
scenarios from a stochastic model, such that stressed random variables
fulfil given probabilistic constraints (e.g. specified values for risk
measures), under the new scenario weights. Scenario weights are selected by
constrained minimisation of the relative entropy to the baseline model.

 The new version includes additional functionalities which are illustrated
in the Vignette on a credit risk model:

Dear all,

this is to announce that a new version of*SamplingStrata*  
       is available on CRAN.*SamplingStrata*  is a package for the
       optimization of stratified sample design. This new version (the
       1.5) contains a lot of news. In particular:

- there is now the possibility to cover also*spatial sampling*,
       whenever the units in sampling frame are geo-referenced (method =
       "spatial" in*optimStrata *function);

- the use of the function*optimStrata *(a wrapper that call different
	optimization functions) greatly simplifies the handling of*takeall *
	strata;

- when models are used in order to take into account the*anticipated variance*  of target variables, a new function (computeGamma)
       permits to evaluate*heteroscedasticity*  in order to
       correctly calculate the overall variance in strata.

A*cheatsheet*  is available in the /docs/inst directory.

Dear all,

I would bring your attention to the new release of hydroPSO (v0.5-0),
which is on CRAN now: https://cran.r-project.org/package=hydroPSO.


Among its new features stand out:

 o Full compatibility with (hydrological/environmental) models
implemented as R functions (e.g., TUWmodel, GR4J, etc)

 o New vignette showing how to calibrate TUWmodel with hydroPSO:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3701902.

 o New vignette showing how to calibrate TUWmodel with GR4J (and other
models of the 'airGR' family): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3712382.

 o 'verification'  : now it is fully compatible with R-based models
and allows parallelisation.

 o 'read_results', plot_results', 'read_out  :much faster now due to
the use of 'data.table::fread' instead of 'read.table'

 o New dataset 'Trancura9414001' with daily time series on P, Temp,
PET, and Q from 1979 to 2016.

 o Package tested against R 4.0.0 (unstable) (2020-03-17 r77992) --
"Unsuffered Consequences", following an imperative request made by
CRAN.

 o All the new features can be read at:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hydroPSO/NEWS


I hope you enjoy it !.

Subject: [R-pkgs] multivariance: Measuring Multivariate Dependence Using
 Distance Multivariance
Message-ID: <47d83b4d-e077-5956-cb49-b252e72818d3@tu-dresden.de>

Dear R-users and developers,

based on a recent series of of papers [1-6] the package 'multivariance' 
(available on CRAN; latest version 2.3.0, 2020-04-23) was developed.
It provides in particular:

+ *fast global tests of independence* for an arbitrary number of 
variables of arbitrary dimensions

+ a detection and visualization algorithm for *higher order dependence 
structures*

+ estimators for multivariate dependence measures which *characterize 
independence*, i.e. the population version is 0 if and only if the 
variables are independent (in contrast to the standard correlation 'cor')

As a side remark, some food for thought: Note that in [3] it is referred 
to over 350 datasets from more than 150 R-packages, which all feature 
some statistical significant higher order dependencies. Some are 
probably artefacts, but in any case it is likely that these have been 
unnoticed and undiscussed so far. Moreover, since it was purely a brute 
force study, this might provide starting points for plenty of research 
by the corresponding field specialists.

Comments and questions on 'multivariance' and the underlying theory are 
welcome.

Best wishes

Bj?rn B?ttcher

Hi All,

I hope this message finds you well.
I have developed the simplePHENOTYPES package to simulate single and multiple (correlated) traits in a wide range of scenarios, including additive, dominance, and epistatic (AxA) models.
The newest version, simplePHENOTYPES v1.2.4, which has just been released on CRAN, has substantial improvements compared to the previous one.

Some of the new features include:
- Options for using VCF, plink bed/ped files, GDS, HapMap, and Numeric as input files.
- Implementation of two types of spurious pleiotropy simulation (?direct" and "indirect").
- Simulation of residual correlation among traits.

Please check it our here:

Message-ID: <986895facff141379e5d379a666e5bcb@UM-MAIL3214.unimaas.nl>

Dear All,

I would like to announce the release of the 'mathjaxr' package: 

https://cran.r-project.org/package=mathjaxr

The package provides MathJax and a handful of macros to enable its use within Rd files for rendering equations in the HTML help files.

Package authors wanting to make use of the package and its functionality need to:

1. install the mathjaxr package,
2. add mathjaxr to 'Suggests' or 'Imports' in the DESCRIPTION file of their package,
3. add mathjaxr to 'RdMacros' in the DESCRIPTION file of their package (or add 'RdMacros: mathjaxr' if the DESCRIPTION file does not yet contain a 'RdMacros' entry),

One can then enable the use of MathJax by calling the \loadmathjax macro within the \description{} section of an .Rd file.

An inline equation can then be added with the \mjeqn{latex}{ascii} macro, with the LaTeX commands for the equation given between the first set of curly brackets (which will be rendered in the HTML and PDF help pages) and the plain-text version of the equation given between the second set of curly brackets (which will be shown in the plain text help). With the \mjdeqn{latex}{ascii} macro, one can add 'displayed equations' (as in LaTeX's displaymath environment). Single argument versions of these macros, namely \mjseqn{latexascii} and \mjsdeqn{latexascii}, are also available.

I hope package authors will find this useful for providing fully rendered equations not only in the PDF manual, but also in the HTML help files (which the vast majority of users are probably looking at).

Feedback, comments, suggestions more than welcome. For bug reports, please go to:

https://github.com/wviechtb/mathjaxr/issues

Best,
Wolfgang

Hi all,


I'm writing to you to introduce our new package, copent. This package estimates copula entropy, a new mathematical concept for multivariate statistical independence measure and testing [1].&nbsp; The estimating method is nonparametric and can be applied to any cases without making assumptions. The package has been used for 
&nbsp;* association discovery [2], in which copula entropy is an association measure shown to be better than correlation coeffients,
&nbsp;* structure learning [3],
&nbsp;* variable selection [4], and 
&nbsp;* causal discovery [5] by estimating transfer entropy.

Message-ID: <CADu7Xui2NUcCaRZuYMCfb842_=G6+_F-Z39dDHxKr33t6Xpbpw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm pleased to announce that the 'strand' package is now available on CRAN.

The package provides a framework for performing discrete (share-level)
simulations of investment strategies. Simulated portfolios optimize
exposure to an input signal subject to constraints such as position size,
factor and category exposure limits, and trading limits. Features include
YAML-based configuration, realistic trade filling based on percentage of
actual volume, and automatic loosening of exposure constraints if no
solution is found.

Please let me know if you have any feedback or questions.

Best,

Subject: [R-pkgs] collapse package: Advanced and Fast Data Transformation in
 R
Message-ID: <CAOsNuxCjVm+eRFnK+=7s1PuG7_Nc1UtFBAzgmpj2tgsug=kaLw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users, with some delay I would like to make you aware of the recent
CRAN release of *collapse* (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=collapse), a
large new C/C++ based package for advanced and high-performance general
purpose data transformation in R.

*collapse* has 2 main objectives:

1. To facilitate complex data transformation and exploration tasks in R.
*(In particular grouped and weighted statistical computations, advanced
aggregation of mixed-type data, advanced transformations of time-series and
panel-data, and the manipulation of lists)*

2. To help make R code fast, flexible, parsimonious and programmer
friendly.
*(Providing order of magnitude performance improvements via extensive use
of C/C++ and highly optimized R code, broad object orientation and
infrastructure for grouped programming)*

*collapse*'s main innovation to service these objectives is the
introduction of a comprehensive set of fast generic functions and
transformation operators, with methods for all standard R objects written
in C++.

Currently *collapse* provides 13 fast statistical functions (`fmean`,
`fmedian`, `fmode`, `fsum`, `fprod`, `fsd`, `fvar`, `fmin`, `fmax`,
`ffirst`, `flast`, `fNobs` and `fNdistinct`) supporting grouped and
weighted computations on vectors, matrices and data.frames, and 8
specialized vector-valued functions and associated transformation operators
(`fscale/STD`, `fbetween/B`, `fwithin/W`, `fHDbetween/HDB`,
`fHDwithin/HDW`, `flag/L/F`, `fdiff/D/Dlog` and `fgrowth/G`) particularly
useful for the transformation of time-series and panel-data. Furthermore
the function `collap` painlessly handles complex aggregations of mixed-type
data, and the function `qsu` computes fast (panel-) summary statistics.

Together with these functions, *collapse* also attempts to formalize and
speed up C++ based grouped programming in R: The function `GRP` creates
grouping objects which can be passed to the `g` argument of the above
functions. This eliminates all time spent on grouping when performing
several computations over the same groups! The `TRA` function also exists
for grouped replacing and sweeping out of any computed statistics.

To round things off, *collapse* provides full sets of functions for very
fast manipulation of data.frames, fast ordering, fast factor generation,
fast conversions between common data objects, and for recursive list
processing (such as the function `unlist2d` which creates a tidy data.frame
from a nested list of heterogeneous data objects).

To enhance compatibility with existing frameworks, *collapse* functions
provide methods for *dplyr* grouped tibbles and *plm* classes for
panel-data (pseries and pdata.frame). *data.table*'s are also supported by
all functions. These methods allow for easy integration of *collapse*'s
fast functions into any of the workflows with these packages. The default
methods for transformation functions like `fscale` or `flag` can also
handle most time-series classes. In general attributes are preserved as
much as possible in all *collapse* computations.

Regarding performance: *collapse* seems to be the fastest R package for a
good share of the functionality it offers. Sizable performance gains can be
realized over packages like *dplyr* or *data.table* for various grouped
computations. The emphasis is on C++, and R code employed is carefully
micro-optimized, so a *collapse* script typically evaluates significantly
faster than, say, a *dplyr* script doing the same thing. Some benchmarks
are in the vignettes.

*collapse* also realizes an innovative approach to documentation.
Installing the package and calling `help("collapse-documentation")` brings
up a full hierarchically structured documentation. The introductory
vignette also introduces all main features in a systematic way.

At this point, *collapse* 1.2.1 is already a quite mature package with a
stable user API, passing repeated checks of R and C++ code and > 5600 unit
tests on all supported operating systems. The package will continue to
receive active maintenance and development.

I hope that the availability of *collapse* would lead not only to faster
data science, but especially to faster and richer development of complex
statistical techniques. I welcome initiatives of like-minded developers
willing to speed up grouped programming in R via C++, and encourage the use
of the *collapse* API for such endeavors. For any issues, contributions,
comments or suggestions, use github or send me an e-mail.

Best regards,

Sebastian

Message-ID: <4E58D00B-0A44-47EA-810F-9EB09EDC02D2@act.ulaval.ca>

Dear useRs and developeRs,

We are proud to announce that version 3.0-0 of actuar is now available on CRAN.

This newest release further extends support of the package for heavy tail and extreme value size distributions. It also introduces a package API, so that developers may easily integrate our C code into their own package.

From the NEWS file:

? Support functions ?[dpqrm,lev]fpareto? for the Feller-Pareto
  distribution and related Pareto distributions with a
  location parameter. The Feller-Pareto defines a large family
  of distributions encompassing the transformed beta family
  and many variants of the Pareto distribution. Using the
  nomenclature of Arnold (2015), the following distributions
  are now supported by ?actuar?: Feller-Pareto, Pareto IV,
  Pareto III, and Pareto II. The Pareto I was already
  supported under the name Single Parameter Pareto.

? The package now exposes through an API its 200+ C routines
  for probability functions and the beta integral. This is
  documented in a new section of the ?distributions? package
  vignette. See file ?include/actuarAPI.h? in the package
  installation directory for the complete list of exported
  routines.

The complete NEWS is available on CRAN as usual:

R Users,

I?m writing to introduce a new package, forestry. This package offers a
series of utility functions to help with reshaping the hierarchy of data
tree, and reform the structure of data tree.

It is particularly useful in these following ways:

1. Reshape tree data then convert to JSON to fit the (nested) JSON format
of your htmlwidget.
2. Manipulate data across a desired level. For example, get `cumsum` data
across a desired level in data tree.

Hopefully you find this useful. Please feel free to reach out with feedback

Message-ID: <CADwGh-7j9nYgr0xV6xOdB-6heHgAaBELiL6GhSm2AQ1qY_A9Vw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

I would like to introduce my R package, admixr, which provides an interface
for performing population genetic analyses using the ADMIXTOOLS suite of
command-line utilities: https://cran.r-project.org/package=admixr.

ADMIXTOOLS (https://www.genetics.org/content/192/3/1065) is a very popular
software in population genetics. However, because each of its command-line
programs requires configuration files specific to each analysis, it is very
cumbersome to use.

The admixr package wraps around ADMIXTOOLS utilities and presents them as
if they were simple R functions. It achieves this by creating all
intermediate files needed by ADMIXTOOLS and extracting relevant statistics
from generated output files, which all happens under the hood.

Extended tutorial and overview of the package can be found at:
https://bodkan.net/admixr/articles/tutorial.html
Any feedback is welcome at: https://github.com/bodkan/admixr/issues

Best regards,
Martin Petr

Message-ID: <CAG25rBKCrMex3yp8yd-QRyXj_3D79m1tY73jNj8y6H7rwObrnA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

Allow me to re-introduce the skedastic package (version 1.0.0) which now
implements more than 20 different heteroskedasticity tests for the linear
regression model, as well as a graphical diagnostic tool and some helper
functions with broader applications (e.g., computing probability
distributions of certain nonparametric statistics, computing two-sided
p-values from asymmetric distributions using three different methods, and
computing cumulative probabilities for ratios of quadratic forms in normal
random vectors).

All of the included heteroskedasticity tests are taken from
statistics/econometrics literature but many of them have never (to my
knowledge) been made available in statistical software until now.

The new version of the package also incorporates unit tests via testthat
and is thus more robust against code breaks.

Message-ID: <febda047-9c87-840b-d995-41e58d116021@mcmaster.ca>

Dear list members,

Christian Kleiber, Achim Zeileis, and I would like to announce a new 
CRAN package, ivreg, which provides a comprehensive implementation of 
instrumental variables estimation using two-stage least-squares (2SLS) 
regression.

The standard regression functionality (parameter estimation, inference, 
robust covariances, predictions, etc.) in the package is derived from 
and supersedes the ivreg() function in the AER package. Additionally, 
various regression diagnostics are supported, including hat values, 
deletion diagnostics such as studentized residuals and Cook's distances; 
graphical diagnostics such as component-plus-residual plots and 
added-variable plots; and effect plots with partial residuals. In order 
to provide these features, the ivreg package integrates seamlessly with 
other packages through suitable S3 methods, specifically for generic 
functions in the base-R stats package, and in the car, effects, lmtest, 
and sandwich packages, among others.

The ivreg package is accompanied by two online vignettes: a brief 
general introduction to the package, and an introduction to the 
regression diagnostics and graphics that are provided.

For more information, see the ivreg CRAN webpage at 
<https://cran.r-project.org/package=ivreg> and the ivreg pkgdown webpage 
at <https://john-d-fox.github.io/ivreg/>.

Comments, suggestions, and bug reports would be appreciated.

John

Subject: [R-pkgs] WriteXLS Version 6.0.0 Released
Message-ID: <068A6271-39B5-42CA-9E96-FC99EA68F137@me.com>

Hi All,

WriteXLS version 6.0.0 has been released and is available on CRAN.

The key changes are:

1. More robust handling of embedded newline ('\n') and carriage return ('\r') characters, double quotes, and two character sequences of a backslash character ('\') followed by another character, within a data value, has been implemented. An indirect consequence of this more robust handling, is better support for multiline cells in the resultant Excel worksheet.

2. New 'AllText' argument to globally handle/overcome Excel's default reformatting of erstwhile numeric values with leading and/or trailing zeros. This option enhances prior improvements to preserving leading and/or trailing zeros on a worksheet cell specific basis.

3. Updated Perl libraries are included as apropos.


Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Subject: [R-pkgs] fmpcloudr package
Message-ID: <5D40F6F7-71CB-4A7F-BE1A-4CB398F6BB80@gmail.com>

Hello,

As recommended in https://r-pkgs.org/release.html <https://r-pkgs.org/release.html>, I wanted to notify the R community about a new package for accessing financial data metrics. The package fmpcloudr (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fmpcloudr <https://cran.r-project.org/package=fmpcloudr>) interacts with the FMP API. 

FMP offers historical pricing data for indexes, stocks, ETFs, mutual finds, currencies, and crypto. Other financial metrics are available such as technical indicators (EMA, RSI, etc), company financials, and 13F. It?s a great data source and could be beneficial to many R users. You can find more details about the package here: https://tonytrevisan.github.io/fmpcloudr/ <https://tonytrevisan.github.io/fmpcloudr/>

Thank you for supporting such an incredible open source community. Learning R has dramatically reshaped my career path which would have been impossible without the R community.  

Best regards,
Tony

Subject: [R-pkgs] xmlconvert: A package for converting XML data to R data
 frames and vice versa
Message-ID: <015e01d6b359$bf0c8ba0$3d25a2e0$@zuckarelli.de>

Hello everyone,



Driven by the need to work with XML data from medical systems that use
object-oriented databases I have developed the 'xmlconvert' package. With
its easy-to-use functions xml_to_df() and df_to_xml() it allows to convert
data from XML to R data frames and vice versa. A variety of arguments gives
you control over the specifics of the conversion process.



The package is available on CRAN (visit
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xmlconvert for more details). Install it
by executing

> install.packages("xmlconvert", dependencies = TRUE)

in the R console.



You will find more information on GitHub
(https://github.com/jsugarelli/xmlconvert). The GitHub README provides an
intro how to use the package and how to adjust for different ways in which
the data can be represented in the XML documents.



Best,



Joachim

Subject: [R-pkgs] Package 'sftrack': Modern classes for tracking and
 movement data
Message-ID: <892cc4c8-fa44-2d8d-db3a-a9f6818b2d9f@ufl.edu>

Dear R users and developers,

The 'sftrack' package is finally on CRAN!

https://cran.r-project.org/package=sftrack

'sftrack' provides modern classes for tracking and movement data, relying
on 'sf' spatial infrastructure. Tracking data are made of tracks, i.e.
series of locations with at least 2-dimensional spatial coordinates (x,y),
a time index (t), and individual identification (id) of the object being
monitored; movement data are made of trajectories, i.e. the line
representation of the path, composed by steps (the straight-line segments
connecting successive locations). 'sftrack' is designed to handle movement
of both living organisms and inanimate objects. A dedicated website with
extensive vignettes and documentation can be found at:

https://mablab.org/sftrack/

The development and design of the 'sftrack' package follow three simple
principles:

* Minimal and focused: this is basically the Unix philosophy. Do a simple
thing, and do it well. The scope of the package is limited (see above),
with as few dependencies as possible;
* User-friendly: 'sftrack' is designed to be as easy to use as familiar R
structures like data.frames and 'sf' objects. 'sftrack' objects are tidy,
and follow the idea that rows are records (locations) and columns are
variable (following the semantics of tracking and movement data);
* Flexible and extensible: 'sftrack' is meant first for users to use on
their data, but also directly designed to address other developers? needs
for their own tracking packages. If you are a developer of a tracking
package, and you are interested in the classes provided by 'sftrack',
please do not hesitate to contact us (for instance at
https://github.com/mablab/sftrack/issues).

You can directly install the version available on CRAN
('install.packages("sftrack")'), but note that the development version
currently goes a step (!) forward by implementing a true representation of
time steps (t1?t2), which makes each step completely defined by itself
(x,y,t1?x,y,t2) and independent from other steps (each step can be handled
on its own). See the details of the implementation in the documentation of
the dev branch:

https://mablab.org/sftrack/dev/articles/sftrack6_time.html

Best,
Mathieu Basille, for the 'sftrack' team.

Hello,

Some weeks ago the experDesign package was released on CRAN:
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=experDesign
The package helps designing experiments to avoid batch effects
confounding the result by distributing the samples on batches
according to their features.

If you or your colleagues design this kind of analysis I hope
experDesign will be useful. I greatly appreciate your feedback,
especially if you find bugs (despite the testing) or think of any
improvement.

To all developers, maintainers and the CRAN team that made this
possible: Thank you!

Best regards,

Llu?s

Hi All,

WriteXLS version 6.1.0 has been released and is in the process of becoming available via CRAN.

This is a bug fix release, as in version 6.0.0, there were occasions where certain integer values in source data frames, containing specific patterns of trailing and embedded zeros, were written to the Excel worksheets as left justified text values, as opposed to right justified numeric values.

Please download and install the updated version at your convenience.

Thanks and regards,

Marc Schwartz

Message-ID: <CAB035rJoen8J-s+wYGtxuSD+80+tm4Mr_HfQ4r8eFqzd6a9S-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I wanted to notify the R community about a new package for trading on the
ETRADE platform through an API. The package `etrader` (
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=etrader
<https://cran.r-project.org/package=etrader>) interacts with the ETRADE API
to allow for authentication, trading, account details and more. You can
find more details about the package here:
https://tonytrevisan.github.io/etrader/.

This completes a suite of three finance packages I developed to allow for
automated trading and investing. `rameritrade` and `etrader` allow for
trading on TD Ameritrade and ETRADE which collectively hold more than 16
million accounts and $1.5 trillion in Assets. `fmpcloudr` is a package to
pull data from Financial Modeling Prep (
https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/companies-key-stats-free-api/)
to perform in-depth analysis on a range of financial metrics.

I have a number of articles and 'How To' guides on my blog that show
someone how to fully automate their retirement investing (
https://tonytrevisan.github.io/blog.html). I hope these tools prove useful
to the R community.

Best regards,
Tony

 'ggplot2'
Message-ID: <b941b96f-4b29-c0a9-6446-62938f24dcad@emvt.net>

I'm pleased to announce that package 'tablesgg' is now available:

CRAN: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tablesgg
GitHub:? https://github.com/rrprf/tablesgg

The package displays presentation-quality tables as plots on an R 
graphics device.? It is unique in combining two features:

* It is aware of the logical structure of the table being presented, and 
makes use of that for automatic layout and styling of the table.? This 
avoids the need for most manual adjustments to achieve an attractive 
result.

* It displays tables using `ggplot2` graphics.? External software such 
as LaTeX or HTML or their viewers is not required.

A full set of tools is provided to control table appearance, including 
titles, footnotes and reference marks, horizontal and vertical rules, 
and spacing or grouping of rows and columns.? Many properties can be set 
automatically by specifying _styles_.? Default styles are included, and 
the user can define custom styles.? There are also tools for low-level 
manipulation of the appearance of individual table elements if desired.

Methods are included to display data frames; tables created by R's 
ftable(), table(), and xtabs() functions; and tables created by the 
`tables` and `xtable` packages.? Methods can be added to display other 
table-like objects.

A vignette is included that illustrates usage and options available in 
the package.

 Shiny tables
Message-ID: <008c01d6d1a0$18292310$487b6930$@zuckarelli.de>

Hello everyone,



I have been looking for 'Excel-like' column filters for reactable tables in
Shiny, and finally decided to developed this functionality myself. The basic
idea is that the selection options available in each column filter of a
table depend on the combined selection in all other filters, just as we know
it from popular spreadsheet applications.



As a result, my new package 'shinyfilter' is now available on CRAN (visit
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shinyfilter for more details). Install it
by executing

R> install.packages("shinyfilter", dependencies = TRUE)

in the R console.



You will find more information (including both, a comprehensive tutorial and
a short 'cookbook recipe') on GitHub
(https://github.com/jsugarelli/shinyfilter).



Best,



Joachim
