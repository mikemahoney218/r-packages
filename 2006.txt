Subject: [R-pkgs] new gstat version
Message-ID: <43C3AA44.4000303@geog.uu.nl>

Soon on CRAN a new version of package gstat will emerge, which
has a few minor changes and possible incompatibilities w.r.t. the
previous version(s).

The new gstat (0.9-23) now:
+ depends on sp, and uses internally with Spatial* classes from sp
   if data are provided in the old-fashoned way (as data.frame)
+ has a vignette to get you started with the classes in sp
+ defines krige as a generic; two typical uses are:

# "old-style", using data.frame's:
library(gstat)
data(meuse)
data(meuse.grid)
v = vgm(0.6, "Sph", 900, 0.1) # spherical variogram model
zn.kri1 = krige(log(zinc)~1, ~x+y, meuse, meuse.grid, v)
image(zn.kri1)

# "new-style", using SpatialPointsDataFrame's:
coordinates(meuse) = c("x", "y") # promote meuse to SpatialPointsDataFrame
coordinates(meuse.grid) = c("x", "y") # promote to SpatialPointsDataFrame
gridded(meuse.grid) = TRUE # promote to SpatialPixelsDataFrame
zn.kri2 = krige(log(zinc)~1, meuse, meuse.grid, v)
spplot(zn.kri2[1])

+ provides a generic idw for inverse distance interpolation
(calling sequence identical to krige)

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:
  the krige generic is

     krige(formula, locations, ...)

  based on the class of argument 2 (locations) either of the two
  versions (see above) is called. This means that no named argument
  "data" should be passed in case locations is missing (i.e., when
  data is of class SpatialPointsDataFrame). Instead, pass it as
  argument 2 or as named argument "locations".

Subject: [R-pkgs] Representation of lmer objects will change soon
Message-ID: <40e66e0b0601101236u61c7c269u9c1bea16cb532867@mail.gmail.com>

This is a "heads up" to those using the lmer function for fitting
linear mixed models or generalized linear mixed models.  In the next
few days Martin and I will upload a new version of the Matrix package
that employs a new representation of linear mixed models based on the
supernodal Cholesky factorization provided by Tim Davis's CHOLMOD
library of sparse matrix code.

This representation will be incompatible with the current
representation, which uses a class of blocked compressed sparse
matrices called the dBCMatrix class.  If you have an lmer object
created with the current code you will need to convert it to use it
with the new package.  By far the easiest way to do this is to
recreate it.  (The new code is very fast.)  However, we will also
offer a conversion function for those who no longer have the
information used to produce the model fit.

So the takehome message is that if you are currently using lmer then
you should save the information used to fit a model in addition to
saving the fitted model.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package lspls
Message-ID: <m0lkxgp93a.fsf@bar.nemo-project.org>

Dear R useRs,

A new package `lspls' is now available on CRAN.  It implements the
LS-PLS (least squares--partial least squares) regression method,
described in for instance

J?rgensen, K., Segtnan, V. H., Thyholt, K., N?s, T. (2004) A Comparison of
Methods for Analysing Regression Models with Both Spectral and Designed
Variables; Journal of Chemometrics 18(10), 451--464.

The current version of the package (0.1-0) should probably be
considered `alpha software'.  Nothing is cast in iron yet, and
especially the formula interface and internal structure are apt to
change in future versions.  The software should, however, be fully
usable in its present form.

`lspls' currently includes fit and cross-validation functions with
formula interfaces, a predict method, and plots of scores, loadings
and (R)MSEP values.

Suggestions, bug reports and other comments are very welcome.

Sincerely,
Bj?rn-Helge Mevik

Dear R users,


Version 0.7-1 of the amap package has been uploaded to CRAN.

   Amap package includes standard hierarchical
   clustering and k-means. We optimize implementation
   (with a parallelized hierarchical clustering) and
   allow the possibility of using different distances like
   Eulidean or Spearman (rank-based metric).

   We implement a principal component analysis (with robusts methods).

News of version 0.7-1: a new method of clustering "optimal partiton"

A major advantage of the method is that the number K of classes 
is computed from the data, and ONLY from the data.

I am pleased to announce the first beta release of RGtk2, the R binding 
to GTK 2.0 (actually 2.8.0). RGtk2 works on all three major platforms 
(Linux, Mac, and Windows) and allows one to construct full-featured 
GUI's from within R.

RGtk2 offers virtually complete bindings to the latest GTK, as well as 
some of its dependencies, including Cairo and Pango, and some extras 
like libglade and GtkMozEmbed (on Linux). Almost the entire package was 
documented by transforming the original (C language oriented) API 
documentation to the R perspective.

Please see the following website for details and downloads: 
http://www.ggobi.org/rgtk2.

You'll also find the Cairo R graphics device there, which lets you 
display R graphics within your RGtk2 GUI.

Please send any bug reports to me.

Message-ID: <20060207003936.CDLZ8316.tomts20-srv.bellnexxia.net@JohnDesktop8300>

Dear R-packages list members,

Last month, Peter Muhlberger posted a message to the r-help list that
suggested, among other things, a desire for a more convenient method of
performing Wald tests for statistical models fit in R. 

Thanks largely to Achim Zeleis's help, the linear.hypothesis function in the
car package has been reworked so that (1) it is applicable to any model
object that responds to the generic coef() and vcov() functions (along with
specific methods for lm and glm objects); and (2) permits symbolic
specification of hypotheses as linear equations in the named parameters of
the model. I'd be particularly interested in people's reactions to the new
interface and to learn of any problems that arise

The new version 1.1-0 of the car package (with some other, less significant
changes and additions) is now on CRAN.

Regards,
 John

This package has a few functions that implement the Quine-McCluskey algorithm,

1987 "The Comparative Method").
Future versions of this package will have more functions to address the 
fuzzy-set minimization problems, as well.

Big thanks to the r-help list members, supportive as ever, especially to Gabor 
Grothendieck and Martin Maechler for excellent ideas in the key parts of the 
algorithm.

Reshape version 0.6
===================

Reshape is an R package for flexibly restructuring and aggregating
data.  It's inspired by Excel's pivot tables, and it (hopefully) makes
it very easy to get your data into the shape that you want.  You can find out
more at http://had.co.nz/reshape

What's new in this version?

 * a new function, stamp, which is kind of a cross between by and
cast, and allows for aggregation functions that take an entire data
frame.  See ?stamp for examples

 * deals better with row and column names when subsetting the result

 * a namespace to make it easier to deal with potential name clashes
with other packages

 * better performance

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Regards,

Hadley

Subject: [R-pkgs] adehabitat version 1.4
Message-ID: <43FD7176.8040403@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr>

Dear all,

I have just uploaded to CRAN the version 1.4 of the
package 'adehabitat'. Significant changes are
listed below:

- The eigenanalysis of selection ratios (Calenge and Dufour, 2006, Ecology)
  can now be performed using the function eisera(). It can be used for 
the analysis of
  habitat selection when habitat can be considered to consist of several 
habitat types
  (e.g. vegetation types).

- A new class, the class "ltraj", is now available for the analysis of 
trajectories of animals
  (e.g. for the analysis of data collected using GPS collars). This 
class automatically
  computes the turning angles between successive moves, the absolute 
angles for each move,
  the speeds and the net squared displacement for each relocation. This 
class is to be
  prefered to the class "traj". The class "traj" is now deprecated.
  Note that the data set "puechcirc" is now of the class ltraj.

- The functions making the interface with the package "sp" have been 
updated: 'area2spol'
   converts an object of class 'area' into an object of class 
'SpatialPolygons'. 'spol2area' converts
   an object of class 'SpatialPolygons' or 'SpatialPolygonsDataFrame' 
into an object of class 'area'.
   'attpol2area' gets the data attribute of an object of class 
'SpatialPolygonsDataFrame'
   and stores is into a data frame. 'traj2spdf' converts an object of 
class 'traj' into an object of
   class 'SpatialPointsDataFrame'. 'traj2sldf' converts an object of 
class 'traj' into an object of
   class 'SpatialLinesDataFrame'.

- The function enfa() has been modified:
   The old components "co" and "l1" have been removed from objects of 
class "enfa", as they did not rely
   on solid mathematical theory. The old component "c1" is now named 
"co", and corresponds to
   the scores of habitat variables in the enfa (the squared norm of this 
vector is equal to 1 for
   the identity metric). As previously, the component "li" stores the 
scores of the resource units
   in the ENFA.

- The function df2kasc now accept objects of class "kasc" with one column.

- That's all, thanks for reading !

Questions, comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.
Happy testing,

Version 1.2-0 of the pls package is now available on CRAN.

The pls package implements partial least squares regression (PLSR) and
principal component regression (PCR).  Features of the package include

- Several plsr algorithms: orthogonal scores, kernel pls and simpls
- Flexible cross-validation
- A formula interface, with traditional methods like predict, coef,
  plot and summary
- Functions for extraction of scores and loadings, and calculation of
  (R)MSEP and R2
- A simple multiplicative scatter correction (msc) implementation
- Functions for plotting predictions, validation statistics,
  coefficients, scores, loadings, biplots and correlation loadings.

The main changes since 1.1-0 are

- predict() now handles missing data like the `lm' method does (the
  default is to predict `NA').
- fitted() and residuals() now return NA for observations with missing
  values, if na.action is na.exclude.
- `ncomp' is now reduced when it is too large for the requested 
  cross-validation.
- Line plot parameter arguments have been added to predplotXy(), so
  one can control the properties of the target line in predplot().
- MSEP(), RMSEP(), loadings(), loadingplot() and scoreplot() are now
  generic.

Dear useRs,

Version 0.8-1 of the `party' package will appear on CRAN and its mirrors
in due course. This version implements two new tools:

   o  `mob', an object-oriented implementation of a recently suggested
       algorithm for model-based recursive partitioning (Zeileis, Hothorn,
       Hornik, 2005) has been added. It works out of the box for partitioning
       (generalized) linear regression models, others can be easily plugged
       in. A new vignette "MOB" describes the implementation ideas and
       provides a few examples with nice plots.

   o  `cforest', an implementation of Breiman's random forest ensemble
       algorithm based on conditional inference trees (`ctree') has been
       added and can be used to analyse censored data and weighted
       problems.

Moreover, some minor issues have been addressed and are documented in the 
CHANGES file.

Best wishes,

Torsten, Kurt and Achim.

(Please see note [1] below regarding recipients for this posting. Thanks!)


Executive Summary: 

    Quantian 0.7.9.2 is the second Quantian release based on Knoppix 4.0.2.
    Quantian adds hundreds of scientific / numeric packages, as well as the
    an openMosix enabled 2.4.27 kernel, to the cdrom version of Knoppix. 
    Version 0.7.9.2 ships as one compressed iso file of 2.7gb that is
    
    Relative to the previous release 0.7.9.1, several small bugs have been 
    fixed, Sun's Java 1.5.0 SDK has been added along with several Java-based
    applications (ImageJ, Weka, JGR, Mondrian), several other applications
    have been added, yet more R packages from CRAN and BioC are included and
    a few other packages have been updated.
    
    Quantian now contains over 2550 Debian packages, over 870 packages
    for R and a few extra applications.

    Quantian comes as one bootable dvd iso of 2.85 gb (compressed) with
    over 7.6 gb (uncompressed) of software of interest to quantitative 
    analysists, scientists, researchers or students.


Announcing Quantian release 0.7.9.2
===================================


I   What is it?

    Quantian is a remastering of Knoppix, the self-configuring and directly
    bootable cdrom/dvd that turns any pc or laptop into a full-featured Linux
    workstation, and (parts of) clusterKnoppix, which adds support for
    openMosix-based  cluster computing. However, Quantian differs from
    Knoppix by having a particular focus on quantitative, numerical or 
    scientific applications, and hence adds a very large set of programs of
    interest to applied or theoretical workers in quantitative or data-driven
    fields to the solid base provided by Knoppix..  

    See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian.html for more details.

    
II What Quantian highlights should I care about ?

    o Second release based on Knoppix 4.0.2: Derived from the cdrom version of
      Knoppix, Quantian utilises the unionfs setup of Knoppix to combine two
      compressed loop images for a total of 2.85 gb (from two files of 1.66 gb
      and 1.19 gb) corresponding to over 7.6 gb of software.

    o KDE 3.4/3.5, Kernel 2.6.12; added backport of kernel 2.4.27 with
      openMosix patch for continued openMosix support including unionfs
      support (that was missing in 0.7.9.1)

    o Some highlights in 0.7.9.2 are

      - Java support via the 'Java 1.5.0' SDK from Sun, installed via
        the packages from www.debian-unofficial.org; this allowed us to
	add ImageJ, Weka, Mondrian and JGR.
      
      - some other packages that were added: celestia, cervisia, gcj,
        gnuhtml2latex, inkscape, octplot, oprofile, prospect, praat, rserve,
	wxmaxima, xalan, (x)orsa as well as many library additions/upgrades

      - even more complete R support with 877 packages (25 from 'core R',
        another 76 from Debian packages, and 779 directly installed from CRAN
        and BioConductor, covering over 99% of all packages at CRAN and
        BioConductor [ not counting a handful of windows-only CRAN packages]
        for complete coverage as of 25 Feb 2006), ESS editing in Emacs /
        XEmacs, GGobi visualization, Rpad webinterface, the award winning JGR

    o See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/changelog.html for details.

    o See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/howto.html for several
      short HOWTOs on booting Quantian from hd on either Windows or Linux,
      booting via a bootcd (such as clusterKnoppix), or botting from a 
      USB memory device.  Contributions, corrections, and feedback on these
      HOWTOs is always appreciated.


III Where do I get it?

    o Downloads are available from the main host at Seattle at FHCRC:

            http://quantian.fhcrc.org/
	    rsync://quantian.fhcrc.org/quantian/
      
      and at the East Coast at 

            http://research.warnes.net/downloads/quantian/CURRENT/
	    ftp://research.warnes.net/users/edd/quantian/CURRENT/

      The most recent release is also available at

            http://quantian.alioth.debian.org/

      Note that file size of 2.75 gb may upset web caching system such
      as squid. It may be prudent to rely on rsync or bittorrent instead
      of http.

    o Bittorrents should be available shortly at

            http://www.tlm-project.org/public/distributions/quantian/

    o The main European mirrors should catch up shortly:

            http://sunsite.rediris.es/mirror/quantian

            http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/ftp/pub/Linux/quantian

    o CD/DVD vendors will probably update their offerings soon as well. 
      See the Quantian site for a list.


IV  Mailing lists

    o Two mailing lists exist for Quantian

        quantian-announce	  for announcements, intended to be low volume
        quantian-general	  for general discussions about Quantian

      available via

	http://alioth.debian.org/mail/?group_id=30303

      for subscription info etc., and start using the quantian-general lists
      for general questions, comments, suggestions or discussions about 
      Quantian.

      Quantian-general is subscribed to quantian-announce, so you only need
      to subscribe to one (but can of course subscribe to both).  Posting to
      quantian-general requires a subscription. 

      Reply-To: for this message is quantian-general at lists.alioth.debian.org
      so that discussions can be continued on the list.


V   Bugs fixed from 0.7.9.1

    o The missing default boot option for isolinux has been added, simply
      pressing return at the boot prompt (or waiting) now yields kernel 2.6.

    o Marco Caliari figured out how to add unionfs support to Kernel 2.4.27,
      so we now have openMosix support with the full 7.5 gb of software!

    o Progress from Debian's C++ transition allowed us to update many KDE
      packages, including kdvi. KDE is in parts updates to release 3.5, some
      applications are still from release 3.4. Several other applications
      that were uninstallable in 0.7.9.1 because of C++ library conflicts
      (celestia, gdal) are now included.
     

VI  Known Bugs in 0.7.9.2

    o Only under kernel 2.4.27, kdesktop comes up with an error message
      that needs to be acknowledged. Konsole then has a broken color schema.
      Simply selecting a working schema, and manually running kdesktop fixes
      this.

    o No other issue as of 28 Feb 2006. Please report anything you notice
      to the quantian-general mailing list.


VII Other items

    o Feedback / poll on package additions or removal

      As always, I welcome comments and suggestions about programs to be
      added or removed. Existing Debian packages, and possibly existing
      rpm packages, typically get inserted quite readily.

      Please send feedback, questions, comments, ... to the 
      
	quantian-general at lists.alioth.debian.org

      list to maximise the number of eyes glancing at any one question.
      Notice that a subscription to the list is needed in order to post.

    o Feedback would also be appreciated on ways to better communicate with
      difference scientific communities that could be interested in Quantian.


VIII Notes

    [1] This email is sent via the quantian-announce mailing list. I have
        subscribed those whose email addresses are in my quantian mail folder 
        due to prior emails. The quantian-announce mailing list only sends
        moderator-approved posts -- so there should be no spam whatsoever. 
        Anybody who considers this unwanted is kindly asked to send me
        a private mail to get unsubscribed immediately.


Best regards,  Dirk

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package 'portfolio'
Message-ID: <17420.32154.96149.92683@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

We would like to announce the availability of the 'portfolio' package
in R for analysing equity portfolios.  Version 0.2-0 is now available
on CRAN.  To take a look, you can:

> install.packages("portfolio")
...
> vignette("portfolio")

and play around. Those who would just like to check out an
introduction can simply look at:

http://www.kanecap.com/R/portfolio/portfolio.pdf

This is the first, very rough version of a package that we hope to
build and extend over the coming months. Our ambitions for this
project are not small. Hundreds of professionals around the world use
R for portfolio analysis but, right now, we all use our own individual
tools for doing so. That seems a shame.

Of course, one reason for the lack of cooperation is that finance is
largely a zero sum game. Every dollar that we make is a dollar that
someone else loses. But, at least when it comes to analysis tools
(rather than alpha generation). This conflict does not seem
insurmountable. We will see.

So, consider this e-mail a call for comment and cooperation. Are there
others out there who would be interested in using this package? Are
there others willing to contribute, if only in terms of bug fixes,
test cases, documentation and the like? Please let us know and, in
fact, let the whole list know.

By releasing a rough version of the package, we are especially
interested in recruiting other developers to the project. None of our
design decisions are set in stone. Serious offers to contribute will
earn a significant say in future development.

Hi,

I recently uploaded a package called "calibrate" to CRAN. This
package contains routines for the calibration of (oblique) axes
in biplots and scatter plots. Documentation provides examples
for ordinary scatter plots with additional axes, biplots from
principal component analysis, correspondence analysis,
canonical correlation analysis and redundancy analysis.

Message-ID: <20060312195513.GA14923@sfu.ca>

Version 0.2 of the package LDheatmap is now on CRAN. The main function 
LDheatmap produces a graphical display, as a heat map, of measures of 
pairwise linkage disequilibria between SNPs. Users may optionally 
include the physical locations or genetic map distances of each SNP on 
the plot.

The revisions to the package are aimed at improving the user's ability 
to modify and annotate the heatmap. Most notably, LDheatmap is now based 
on grid graphics. Examples of how to modify the plot using tools from 
the grid package are included in the LDheatmap help file.

Dear R users,

a new release (v1.5) of Spectrino package is on CRAN.

For those of you not familiar with Spectrino:
Spectrino is a spectra preparation utility for R. It has specialized 
organization and visualization features for spectra. Spectrino has visual 
interface - as Windows application with rich set of features to set a 
structure and manipulate visually spectra and it is accessible from R as a 
library with a set of commands for saving and selective extraction of 
spectral data.

more info at http://www.spectrino.com

For all Spectrino users:
The new in version 1.5:
  - minor bugs fixed.
  - some visual interface improvements.
  - now, the pre-processing options are adjustable from within R - function 
spnPPOpt(opts)
  - the mean extraction is based on a specific group (not on the entire 
set) - more appropriate for discriminant analysis.

Enjoy the new Spectrino !

Dear R-users,

I'd like to announce the new version of package 'ltm' for Item 
Response Theory analysis. The function grm() (along with supporting 
methods, i.e., anova, margins, factor.scores, etc.) has been added for 
fitting the Graded Response Model for ordinal polytomous manifest 
variables. An extra feature of the plot method for classes 'grm', 
'ltm' and 'rasch' is the possibility to plot Item or Test Information 
Curves. You may find a more detailed description of the new features 
of the package in the CHANGES file.

Future plans include development of functions for the three-parameter 
logistic model.

Any kind of feedback (questions, suggestions, bug-reports, etc.) is 
more than welcome.

Best,
Dimitris

Message-ID: <200603210816.00299.ahenningsen@agric-econ.uni-kiel.de>

Dear R users,

The authors of the systemfit package have released a new version of this 
package with substantial enhancements. 
The systemfit package contains functions for fitting simultaneous systems of 
linear equations using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares 
(WLS), Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR), Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS), 
Weighted Two-Stage Least Squares (W2SLS), and Three-Stage Least Squares 
(3SLS). 
The new enhancements include the ability to test linear restrictions using an 
F, Wald or likelihood-ratio test and the ability to test model specification 
using the Hausman test. The major enhancements include better estimation 
using large data sets as well as many minor improvements, e.g. the ability to 
define how the residual covariance matrix and degrees of freedom are 
computed. The new version includes a wrapper function systemfitClassic that 
can be applied to (classical) panel-like data in long format. Furthermore, 
version 0.8-0 includes additional documentation 
(inst/doc/vignette_systemfit.pdf).

Message-ID: <971536df0603280506u7bb23e48he527d21b2ae8e144@mail.gmail.com>

gsubfn is a package with one function, gsubfn, that
is like gsub except instead of taking a replacement
string it takes a replacement function.  For each
match, that match is passed to the replacement
function along with the backreferences, if any,
and replaced with the output of the function.
If the first two arguments are omitted the defaults
are set to do perl-style (sort of) string interpolation
as in last example.

gsubfn is available for all platforms via CRAN.

# makes all letters except first in word lower case
# output: "I Like A Banana Split"
gsubfn("\\B.", tolower, "I LIKE A BANANA SPLIT")

# adds 1 to each number in third arg
# output: "(11 21)(101 31)"
gsubfn("[[:digit:]]+", function(x) as.numeric(x)+1, "(10 20)(100 30)")

# replaces pairs m:n with their sum
# first argument of f is the match; 2nd & 3rd are the 2 backreferences
# output: "abc 30 def 70 50"
f <- function(x,y,z) as.numeric(y)+as.numeric(z)
gsubfn("([0-9]+):([0-9]+)", f, "abc 10:20 def 30:40 50")

# extracts numbers from string and places them into vector v
# v becomes: 12 34 56 89 12
v <- c(); f <- function(x) v <<- append(v,as.numeric(x))
junk <- gsubfn("[0-9]+", f, "12;34:56,89,,12")
v

# string interpolation (perl-style, somewhat)
# output: pi = 3.14159265358979, 2pi = 6.28318530717959

Message-ID: <EC6501D4A6BB5442B583E3FABC9D131F0644899C@exchange.ad.acadiau.ca>

I'd like to announce the availability of a new library for hybrid
hierarchical clustering, "hybridHclust".  The library has been uploaded
to CRAN and is now available.

The library implements a hybrid of top-down and bottom-up hierarchical
clustering.  Along the way, the idea of a "mutual cluster" is developed.
A mutual cluster is a set of observations whose largest within-group
distance is smaller than the distance to the closest point outside the
set.  The hybrid method is a top-down approach that preserves such
mutual clusters.

Mutual clusters are useful in their own right, and have the interesting
property that they cannot be "broken" by many bottom-up methods.  Tools
that graphically integrate mutual clusters into bottom-up methods are
also included in the library.

Lastly, an implementation of Michael Eisen's bottom-up clustering
algorithm is also in the library.

A paper, soon to appear in Biostatistics, describes this work:

Applications to Microarray Data", available at

coordinator for the actual assignment to treatment as subjects are
enrolled.

It is specialized for visualizing multivariate density functions
and density estimates.

A basic tool is a level set tree,
which makes a recursive approximation of a multivariate function.
With the help of level set trees one may define shape isomorphic
transformations of a multivariate function to a 1D function.

>From version 2.01-17, splancs, a package for spatial point pattern 
analysis, depends on package sp. 

Because both packages have defined a bounding box function bbox(), the
bbox() method in sp has been given priority, and the default object for
dispatch is an array with two or more columns (as in splancs until now).

However, the deprecated splancs function returned a non-closed rectangle
of coordinates, rather than the 2x2 matrix returned by sp bbox().

Consequently, any splancs bbox() uses in user code need to be replaced by
bboxx(bbox()), where bboxx() is a helper function unrolling the sp bbox()  
output into the form used until now by splancs.

With apologies for the bumpy ride,

Subject: [R-pkgs] Version 1.0 of hapassoc now available from CRAN
Message-ID: <20060418195026.GA6763@sfu.ca>

Version 1.0 of hapassoc now available from CRAN

hapassoc is an R package for likelihood inference of trait associations 
with SNP haplotypes and other attributes using the EM Algorithm. Recent 
changes include the addition of anova and logLik methods for the 
class hapassoc, to allow users to perform likelihood ratio tests of 
haplotype effects. Other changes include bug-fixes and improvements to 
the documentation, such as the addition of a package vignette. See the 
exerpt from the ChangeLog for more details.

ChangeLog

2006-04-04 Version 1.0

 * hapassoc(): the "baseline" argument is documented to have default
   equal to the most common haplotype, but the code to implement this
   default was lost and needed to be replaced.
 * hapassoc(): added a "verbose" flag. Default is verbose=FALSE. If
   TRUE users see the iteration number and value of the convergence
   criterion at each iteration of the EM algorithm.
 * pre.hapassoc(): added a "verbose" flag. Default is verbose=TRUE.
   If TRUE users see a list of the SNP genotypes used to form
   haplotypes and a list of the other "non-haplotype" variables.
 * Package vignette "hapassoc" added. After loading the package, type
   vignette("hapassoc") to view.

2006-03-22

 * Overall addition of the log-likelihood functions
 * hapassoc(): function now returns log-likelihood and model
 * logLik.hapassoc(): New function to extract the log-likelihood from
   a hapassoc object
 * anova.hapassoc(): New function to perform likelihood ratio test on
   two hapassoc objects.

2006-02-02 Minor changes:

 * EMvar(): fixed a bug occurring when all haplotype phases are known.
 * RecodeHaplos(): fixed a bug where a single column of non-haplotype
   data in a non-allelic data set was losing its name.
 * hapassoc(): Change "..." argument of hapassoc to "start".
   Previously the only intended use of "..." was to allow the user to
   pass in "start" for starting values to the glm function, rather
   than to allow the user to pass in other optional arguments to glm.
   We have now made this more explicit by making this argument more
   specific.

Version 1.2-1 of the pls package is now available on CRAN.

This is mainly a bugfix-release.  If you fit multi-response models,
you are strongly engouraged to upgrade!


The main changes since 1.2-0 are

- Fixed bug in kernelpls.fit() that resulted in incorrect results when fitting
  mulitresponse models with fewer responses than predictors
- Changed default radii in corrplot()

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package connectedness
Message-ID: <4457352C.2060908@bfro.uni-lj.si>

Dear R users,

I would like to announce a new package connectedness on CRAN.
connectedness can be used to identify disconnected sets. It contains
functions to find, plot and subset disconnected sets in a two-way
classification without interaction.

Please do not hesitate to contact me, if you find a bug (possibly with a
patch) or you have any comments.

Short Descriptions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
************ "distr":
"distr" is to provide a conceptual treatment of random variables
(r.v.'s) by means of S4--classes. A virtual mother class "Distribution"
is introduced.
All distributions of the "stats" package are implemented as subclasses of
either "AbscontDistribution" or "DiscreteDistribution".

Using these classes, we also provide (default) methods to automatically
generate the image distributions under unary mathematical operations as
well as a general convolution algorithm.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
************ "distrSim":
Classes and methods are provided for a standardized treatment of
simulations (also under contaminations) .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
************ "distrTEst":
Classes and methods are provided for a standardized treatment of
the evaluation of statistical procedures (up to now only estimators)
at data/simulations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
************ "distrEx":
This package provides some extensions to package "distr" like:
* extreme value distribution classes,
* expectations
  +in the form E(X)  for the expectation of X where X is some
    distribution or
  +in the form E(X,f) for the expectation of f(X) where X is
     some distribution and f some function in X,
* further functionals: var, sd, IQR, mad, median
* truncated moments,
* distances between distributions
  (Hellinger, Kolmogorov, total variation, "convex contamination")
* lists of distributions,
* conditional distributions in factorized form
* conditional expectations in factorized form

Message-ID: <085FC762-1603-47A5-A147-C26DBB87DD23@soc.soton.ac.uk>

Dear List

Please find uploaded to CRAN a new package, "partitions" that
enumerates integer partitions using C.  A paper describing the
package has recently been accepted by JSS (volume 16, codesnippet 1).

Integer partitions arise in many branches of combinatorics,
and the partition function P(n) is the subject of much investigation
in pure mathematics.

The package enumerates the partitions, unequal partitions, and  
restricted
partitions of an integer; the corresponding partition functions are  
also given.
The package can conjugate partitions and calculate the Durfee square
of a partition.

I would be very interested to hear any comments or suggestions that the
List may have.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0606061038340.8514@nokomis.stat.uiowa.edu>

Release 0.4-0 of package misc3d is now available from CRAN.  This
package provides a small collection of functions for 3D plotting,
including 'contour3d' for computing and rendering 3D contours or
isosurfaces and 'parametric3d' for rendering parameterized surfaces.

A major change in this release is that rendering in standard and grid
graphics is now supported in addition to rgl.  To support rendering in
standard and grid graphics the package includes some functions for
managing and rendering triangle mesh representations of surfaces.
Rendering uses simple lighting and shading algorithms to represent 3D
structure.  The examples in

    example(contour3d)
    example(parametric3d)
    demo(lighting)
    demo(teapot)

illustrate some of the features.

Subject: [R-pkgs] zoo: new version 1.1-0
Message-ID: <20060606233146.6bfd068f.Achim.Zeileis@R-project.org>

Dear useRs,

I've just uploaded the new version 1.1-0 of the zoo package for dealing
with regular and irregular time series data to the main CRAN site.
Source and binary packages should be available from the mirrors in the
next days.

There are two changes that are nut fully backwards compatible:
  - The package now has a NAMESPACE and most S3 methods are not exported
    explicitely anymore. If some function needs to be exported for
    useRs/developeRs of other packages, please let us know.
  - By default read.zoo() does not try to produce regular series
    anymore. The previous version could result in misleading
    computations for daily financial data, affecting especially also the
    zoo-quickref vignette. (Thanks to Ajay Shah for pointing this out.)
    The old behaviour can be restored by setting `regular = TRUE'.

For general introductions to the package see:
  vignette("zoo", package = "zoo")
  vignette("zoo-quickref", package = "zoo")

Best wishes,
Z

Subject: [R-pkgs] New R package "pcalg"
Message-ID: <17544.18520.122208.384189@stat.math.ethz.ch>

The R package "pcalg" is released.

The main purpose of this package is to estimate the skeleton of
a DAG given data sampled from a distribution corresponding to
this DAG.

More intuitively, you can search for "strong dependencies" in
potentially high dimensional data sets. The result will be an
undirected graph where each edge represents some dependence
statement. Optionally, the line width can be varied in order to indicate the
reliability of the dependencies found.

For more details have a look at the vignette.

I'd be happy to receive comments and suggestions for improvement.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New version of Subselect package
Message-ID: <E1FppRA-0006Uv-00@DMjcadima>


Version 0.9-99 of package "subselect" is now on CRAN. 

The subselect package has functions that search for k-variable subsets
of a p-variable (p>k) data set that are optimal under some
criterion. Search algorithms include a full search algorithm "leaps",
based on Furnival and Wilson's leaps and bounds algorithm, and three
random search algorithms: a genetic algorithm ("genetic"), a simulated
annealing algorithm ("anneal") and a modified local search algorithm
("improve"). Previous versions of subselect had three criteria for
optimality ("rm", "rv" and "gcd"), based on exploratory data analysis
considerations. This new version adds four new criteria ("tau2",
"zeta2", "xi2" and "ccr12"), associated with the multivariate linear
hypothesis and the well-known test statistics for that hypothesis
(Wilks' lambda, Roy's largest root, Pillai's trace and the
Hotelling-Lawley statistic). Subselect 0.9-99 also includes two
functions that prepare the arguments for the search functions
associated with the new criteria in the most frequent contexts of
application of the multivariate linear hypothesis - linear regression
(function "lmHmat") and linear discriminant analysis ("ldaHmat") - as
well as another function ("glhHmat") that prepares these arguments for
an analysis associated with a hypothesis specified by the user. The
package documentation includes numerous examples.  

Feedback is appreciated.

Best regards,
Jorge Cadima

A new version (0.96.3) of the package 'eha' is now on CRAN. Apart from 
some bug fixes, there are some news. The most noteworthy are: (i) 
'plot.Surv' has a few new options, (ii) 'weibreg' now can fit null 
models (i.e., only scale and shape) and covariates are no longer 
automatically centered (although this is still the default), (iii) there 
is a new function, 'toBinary', which transforms a data frame suitable 
for survival analysis to a data frame suitable for ,eg, logistic 
regression as a substitute for a discrete time cox regression. In the 
process, sampling of survivors in risk sets is possible.

important new feature is the possibility to get a p-value for the test 
of the hypothesis that the variance of the random effects is zero, on 
the wishlist of many R users these days! Note two things: (i) glmmML 
only treats random intercepts for binomial and poisson models, (ii) the 
p-value is calculated thru bootstrapping (can be slow with large data sets).

Message-ID: <f8e6ff050607030025k77d4075bv7faf5b68d54b56b3@mail.gmail.com>

ggplot provides a new system for drawing graphics in R, based on the
Grammar of Graphics. It combines the advantages of both base and
lattice graphics: conditioning and shared axes are handled
automatically, and you can still build up a plot step by step from
multiple data sources. It also implements a more sophisticated
multidimensional conditioning system and a consistent interface to map
data to visual attributes.  ggplot (along with reshape) received the
John Chambers Award for Statistical Computing.

ggplot is available now from CRAN (install.packages("ggplot")) and
more information is available at my website (http://had.co.nz/ggplot)
including copies of talks, examples, and a guide showing how to
convert your existing lattice code.

To get started I recommend you look at:

 * the introductory vignette: vignette("introduction", "ggplot")
 * help for the quick plotting command: ?qplot
 * help for the full plotting commands: ?ggplot

I want to provide great documentation, so if there is anything you
think I am missing, please let me know.

* plot(.) offers feedback and cautions about input format.  

* deskcheck incorporates debug(), in straight forward testing.

* source(.), under development, in error produces a directory listing.

We believe that much remains to be done, but we wanted to solicit
community feedback from interested parties. Please pass on suggestions

Subject: [R-pkgs] package simecol uploaded to CRAN
Message-ID: <44ABDE63.6090204@TU-Dresden.de>

Dear useRs,

a new and completely re-worked version of the "simecol" package

   SIMulatiion of ECOLogical (and other) dynamic systems

is now available on CRAN. Compared to the S3 based 0.2-x versions an
improved object model using S4 classes was employed. Please ask me for
assistance in case of incompatibility.

Comments are welcome, Thomas Petzoldt

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract:
=========

The simecol package is intended to give users (scientists and students)
and interactive environment to implement, distribute, simulate and
document ecological and other dynamic models without the need to write
long simulation programs. An object oriented approach based on the S4
class system is proposed, which should provide a consistent but still
flexible and extensible way to implement dynamic models.

Models of different type are provided as data and in source code (see
directory "examples") which are intended as a starting point to write
and distribute your own simObj models.

The package is supplemented with several utility functions (e.g.
seedfill or neighbours), which can be used independently from simObj
objects.

More Info:
==========

? parms: functions to get or set model parameters etc.


Examples:
=========

Message-ID: <0F923E9EBBF1554ABA641ACA04BEBEC004ED4F22@WS-BCO-MSE7.milky-way.battelle.org>

Two new packages have been added to CRAN.  

The first is a simple package which provides the standard functions for
a triangle distribution (rtriangle, dtriangle, ptriangle, qtriangle).  

The second package generates and augments Latin Hypercube Samples.
Functions for generating random and optimized designs are provided.

I look forward hearing your feedback and improving the documentation!

Subject: [R-pkgs] glmmML updated
Message-ID: <148ed8180607120959j361f7893h3aeab3551fae490@mail.gmail.com>

I have uploaded a new version (0.30-2) of glmmML to CRAN today.

This is a rather extensive upgrade, mostly internal. Adaptive
Gauss-Hermite quadrature (GHQ) is now used for the evaluation of the
integrals in the log likelihood function. The user can choose the number
of points (default is 16), I _think_ that choosing 1 point will result
in a Laplace approximation. The integrals in the score and hessian
are evaluated by the QUADPACK function 'Rdqagi' which is the C code
behind the R function 'integrate'. This specific combination of the two
methods seems to work best. (I often get _exactly_ (up to seven digits)
the same value with the two methods, but in some extreme cases one may
fail and not the other.)

New components in the output from 'glmmML' are 'posterior.means' and
posterior.modes'. The modes are found by using 'vmmin' (behind R's
'optim') on the integrands in the GHQ, the means by numerical
integration. Usually, they do not differ much.

A special problem is situations where the random effects variance is
very small or zero. I may happen that glmmML is unable to get the
likelihood value above the value given by 'glm' on the corresponding
model with no clustering. In such a case zero variance is reported, with
a standard error that is NA. A warning is also given. If a test of the
hypothesis that sigma = 0 is on the wish list, a p-value can be
estimated by bootstrapping, see the input parameter 'boot'. The only
option now is a parametric bootstrap; I have removed the 'conditional'
approach.

As usual, comments, and error and bug reports are welcome.

The odfWeave package is now available on CRAN at

http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/src/contrib/Descriptions/odfWeave.html

and your local mirror.

The package extends Sweave to Open Document Format (ODF) text document 
files. Latex-style code chunks and in-line Sexpr commands can be used 
to embed R output into ODF file, which can then be exported to doc, 
rtf, html, pdf and other formats.

Other functions in the package facilitate ODF formatted tables, text 
and lists.

The current limitations of the package are:

 O tangling is not yet implement (but will be)

 O testing has been done on text documents generated by OpenOffice. 
   Other formats/editors may work, but are not (yet) supported.

Please send comments, suggestions and/or contributions.

Message-ID: <b0808fdc0607210119q34a4933re2f10d45309d7478@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,
I've just uploaded  2 packages on CRAN, RTisean and tsDyn, both for time
series analysis (joint research projects with members of the Statistics
Department, University of Udine). Brief descriptions follow.

RTisean is an R interface to TISEAN executables
(http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~tisean/). TISEAN is a suite of C
and Fortran routines for nonlinear time series analysis, coded and
documented by Rainer Hegger, Holger Kantz and Thomas Schreiber. In
RTisean, almost all TISEAN routines are wrapped in a conventional R
function (which silently calls TISEAN executables), with online help
and examples (thanks to Gianluca Gazzola).

tsDyn is a package for nonlinear time series modelling. At this point
the package focuses on Nonlinear Autoregressive Models, often indicated as
NLAR (as a major reference, see Tong (1990)). Currently available are
threshold (SETAR and LSTAR), neural networks (NNET), and additive
autoregressive (AAR) models. An experimental cross-platform tcltk GUI is
included for model selection. Explorative and diagnostic tools are
also available. A vignette is included for a clearer presentation of the
package contents.

Comments and suggestions appreciated

Subject: [R-pkgs] seqinr updated :  release 1.0-5
Message-ID: <44C60DA8.6070602@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr>

Dear R users,


seqinR 1.0-5 has been released yesterday on CRAN, so that the source code
of the package should be available on all CRAN mirrors within the next 24h.

The updated package vignette is here:
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/seqinr_1_0-5.pdf

User level visible changes are:

o  A  new function dotPlot() is now available.
   
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/dotPlot.html

o  A new function crelistfromclientdata() is now available to create a 
list on
   the server from a local file of sequence names, sequence accession 
numbers,
   species names, or keywords names.

http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/crelistfromclientdata.html 


o  A new function pmw() to compute the molecular weight of a protein is now
   available.
   http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/pmw.html

o  A new function reverse.align() contributed by Anamaria Necsulea is now
   available to align CDS at the protein level and then reverse translate
   this at the nucleic acid level from a clustalw output. This can be done
   on the fly if clustalw is available on your platform.

http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/reverse.align.html 


o  An undocumented behavior was reported by Guy Perriere for uco() when
   computing RSCU on sequences where an amino-acid is missing. There is
   now a new argument NA.rscu that allows the user to force the missing
   values to his favorite magic value.
   http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/uco.html

o  There was a bug in read.fasta(): some sequence names were truncated, 
this
   is now fixed (thanks to Marcus G. Daniels for pointing this).
   In order to be more consistent with standard functions such as 
read.table()
   or scan(), the file argument starts now with a lower case letter 
(i.e."file")
   in function read.fasta(), but the old-style "File" is still 
functional for
   forward-compatibility. There is a new logical argument in read.fasta()
   named as.string to allow sequences to be returned as strings instead of
   vector of single characters. The automatic conversion of DNA 
sequences into
   lower case letters can now be disabled with the new logical argument
   forceDNAtolower. It is also possible to disable the automatic attributes
   settings with the new logical argument set.attributes.

http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/read.fasta.html 


o  A new function write.fasta() is now available.

http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/write.fasta.html 


o  The function kaks() now forces character in sequences to upper case.
   This default behavior can be neutralized in order to save time by 
setting the
   argument forceUpperCase to FALSE.
   http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/kaks.html

all the best,

Simon

A new version of odfWeave is on CRAN. Changes include:

 - handling of locales. Errors were being produced when locales were set
to anything but "C". The fix changes the locale to "C" and changes back
to the original locale when the user's code is executed.

 - a bug fix for default plot device units (to prevent bitmap graphics
from being 480x480 inches on non-Windows systems).

 - a check was inserted at the beginning of the odfWeave function to
test for zipping/unzipping utilities. This is only done if the default
value for zipCmd in odfWeaveControl was not used. A more meaningful
error message is produced.

 - the manual is now a "legal" package vignette and accessible using
vignette("odfWeave").

Message-ID: <f8e6ff050608060753w28e532cby139b9abdf579844@mail.gmail.com>

Reshape 0.7
===================

Reshape is an R package for flexibly restructuring and aggregating
data. It is inspired by Excel's pivot tables, and it  makes it very
easy to view your data the way you want. The reshape package (along
with ggplot) received the John Chambers Award for Statistical
Computing. You can find out more at http://had.co.nz/reshape.

Reshape (hopefully) makes it easy to do what you have been struggling
to do with tapply, by, aggregate, xtabs, apply and summarise.  It is
also useful for getting your data into the correct structure for
lattice or ggplot plots.

This new version of reshape substantially expands the type of output
you can cast into.  You can now make nested lists, cast(m, a ~ b | c)
or cast(m, a ~ b | c + d), and multidimensional arrays, cast(m, a ~ b
~ c) (or any combination of the two).  See the examples in ?cast.

What else is new?:

 * iapply, an idempotent apply function that returns results with the
same dimensionality as the input (very useful in conjunction with
sweep and multidimensional arrays)

 * rescaler, a function to rescale data.frames variable by variable
using a range of different scaling methods

 * combine_factor and reorder_factor to make it easier to combine and
reorder factor levels

 * bug fixes!

All feedback is welcomed, and if you are struggling with reshaping
your data and the reshape package isn't helping, please let me know.

Regards,

Hadley

NEWS?

o NA's in either x or y are not removed by default, but only when
  drop=TRUE. Subset method gains dropNA=NULL argument due to
  this. Now subset arguments are properly placed after '...'. 2006-08-08

o Added unit tests. 2006-08-08

o Removed connectedness.package.Rd as it is not really needed
  here. 2006-08-08

o LGPL -> GPL. 2006-06-17

o Removed dependency on package RColorBrewer since this was not really
  needed. I needed RColorBrewer only to get a set of default distinct
  colors. 2006-06-17

o Only unique levels are printed out in Levels* columns. 2006-06-06

o Percent in form of 33 and not 0.33. 2006-06-06

o Minor documentation fixes - typos etc. 2006-05-02

Subject: [R-pkgs] Random Survival Forest 1.0.0 is now available.
Message-ID: <DOEKJCLKLCEDEDHLDCJICEFOCNAA.ubk@kogalur-shear.com>

Dear useRs,

Release 1.0.0 of the new R package 'randomSurvivalForest' is now available
on CRAN and its mirrors.  The package implements Ishwaran and Kogalur's
Random Survival Forests algorithm for right censored survival data.  The
algorithm is closely patterned after Breiman's random forests, but suitably
modified for the survival setting.  Some key features are:

o An ensemble cumulative hazard is constructed
    from binary recursive survival trees grown
    under different splitting rules.

o Mortality estimates interpretable in terms
    of total number of deaths are provided.

o An out-of-bag estimate of Harrell's concordance
    index is provided for assessing prediction.

Detailed information on usage can be found in the manual.

Thank you.

Hemant Ishwaran,  Udaya B. Kogalur

A new version, 0.65-1, of glmmML is now on CRAN. It is a major rewrite
of the inner structures, so frequent updates (bug fixes) may be
expected for some time.

News:

* The Laplace and adaptive Gauss-Hermite approximations to the log
likelihood function are fully implemented. The Laplace method is made
the default. It should give results you can compare to the results
from 'lmer' (for the models that glmmML can handle).

* Binomial responses can now be represented as a two-column matrix
with No. of successes and No. of failures, respectively, as in glm.

* New functions: 'ghq' for calculating the constants used in the
Gauss-Hermite quadrature. 'extractAIC.glmmML', which makes it possible
to use functions like 'dropterm' (MASS) on glmmML fits.

* There are three choices of distribution for the random effects:
'gaussian' (default), 'logistic', and 'cauchy'.

* The 'conditional' bootstrap is removed, so the only choice now is
the parametric bootstrap.

* The 'posterior.means' are no longer calculated, leaving only the
'posterior.modes' as 'predictions' of the random effects.

As usual, feedback is more than welcome!

Subject: [R-pkgs] ANN: 'weaver' package, caching for Sweave
Message-ID: <m2u045zf1a.fsf@ziti.fhcrc.org>

Hi all,

I've added a new package 'weaver' to the BioC repository:

http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/1.9/bioc/html/weaver.html

The weaver package provides extensions to the Sweave utilities
included in R's base package.  The focus of the extensions is on
caching computationally expensive (time consuming) code chunks in
Sweave documents.

Why would you want to cache code chunks?  If your Sweave document
includes one or more code chunks that take a long time to compute, you
may find it frustrating to make small changes to the document.  Each
run requires recomputing the "expensive" code chunks.  If these chunks
aren't changing, you can benefit from the caching provided by weaver.

To install:

  source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
  biocLite("weaver")

If you give it a try and have any feedback, drop me a note.

Best Wishes,

+ seth

At present, the above install sequence will _only_ work if you are
using a development version of R.

If you are using the current R release, you will have to work a bit
harder to install (put weaver works there too):

First install weaver's dependencies:

  digest (on CRAN)

  codetools:
    http://bioconductor.org/packages/1.9/omegahat/html/codetools.html

Then install weaver:
    http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/1.9/bioc/html/weaver.html

Finally, I will try to make Windows binaries available by the end of
the week.

A new version 1.9-5 of the package `spatstat' 
has been uploaded to CRAN.

What it is:
----------
spatstat is a package for analysing spatial data, mainly Spatial Point
Patterns. 

What's in it:
------------
Functions for exploratory data analysis, model-fitting, simulation,
spatial sampling, model diagnostics, and formal inference. Data types
include point patterns, line segment patterns, spatial windows, and
pixel images. Point patterns may include marks (e.g. multitype
points).  Spatial windows can have irregular shape (polygons with
holes, binary images).  Point process models can be fitted to point
pattern data. Cluster models are fitted by the method of minimum
contrast. Very general Gibbs point process models can be fitted to
point pattern data using a function ppm similar to lm or glm. Models
may include dependence on covariates, interpoint interaction and
dependence on marks. Fitted models can be simulated
automatically. Also provides facilities for formal inference (such as
chi-squared tests) and model diagnostics (including simulation
envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots).

Spatstat is one of the largest packages available on CRAN,
with over 270 functions.

Dear useRs,

the new version 1.2-0 of the zoo package for dealing with regular and
irregular time series data is available from the CRAN mirrors.

This version includes two important changes/enhancements:

  - rapply() was re-named to rollapply() because from R 2.4.0 on,
    base R provides a function rapply() for recursive (not rolling)
    application of functions, which was already described in the Green
    Book. zoo::rapply() currently still exists for backward
    compatibility, however, it is flagged as deprecated and now
    dispatches to rollapply() methods. We recommend to change existing
    scripts from using rapply() to rollapply().

  - xyplot() methods for "zoo", "ts", and "its" objects have been
    added for creating trellis time series graphs. The functions
    are still under development and suggestions for improvement are
    welcome.

For general introductions to the package see:

Dear useRs,

a new version 2.0-0 of the sandwich package for estimating sandwich
covariance matrices is available from the CRAN mirrors.

The tools for computing heteroskedasticity (and autocorrelation)
consistent covariance matrix estimators (also called HC
and HAC estimators, including the Eicker-Huber-White estimator)
have been generalized over the last releases from linear regression to
general parametric models. These new object-oriented features of the
sandwich package are also described in paper published in the Journal
of Statistical Software (JSS) that accompanies this release. See
  http://www.jstatsoft.org/

The new JSS paper and the previous one (accompanying version 1.0-0) are

Subject: [R-pkgs] The rpanel package
Message-ID: <44F45F0E.4010802@stats.gla.ac.uk>

The rpanel package builds on the tcltk package to provide simple 
interactive controls for R functions, in particular to provide simple 
forms of dynamic graphics.  The intention is to make this form of 
control particularly easy for R users to implement, with full 
documentation.  The necessary tcltk variables are managed behind the 
scenes so that users need not be concerned with any technicalities.

A descriptive paper and some simple example scripts are available at
	www.stats.gla.ac.uk/~adrian/rpanel/
The package is now available from CRAN.

Message-ID: <20060830113736.EBRT24981.tomts40-srv.bellnexxia.net@JohnDesktop8300>

I've submitted a new, and substantially enhanced, version (1.2-0) of the
Rcmdr package to CRAN. Some highlights (from the CHANGES) file:

   o  Added ability to import from Excel, Access or dBase files (contributed
by Samir Messad, Renaud Lancelot and Matthieu Lesnoff).

   o  Added ability to read data from the clipboard (suggested by Graham
Smith).

   o  Added "Data -> Active data set -> Stack variables in active data set"
(suggested by Richard Heiberger).
   
   o  Added many probability distributions, courtesy of Miroslav Ristic and
G. Jay Kerns, Andy Chang, and Theophilius Boye.
   
   o  Added dialogs to sample from probability distributions; divided
distributions menus into Continuous and Discrete.
   
   o  Added totPercents function. Added total percentages and components of
chi-square to two-way tables (suggested by Richard Heiberger).
      
   o  Added "Statistics -> Summaries -> Count missing observations".
   
   o  Added "Statistics -> Summaries -> Correlation test", contributed by
Stefano Calza.
      
   o  The numerical summaries, table of statistics, frequency distributions,
numeric to factor, and recode dialogs will now process multiple variables in
parallel (suggested by Bo Sommerlund).
   
   o  Added function numSummaries for neater output from "Statistics ->
Summaries -> Numerical summaries" (motivated by comments from Bo
Sommerlund).
   
   o  XY conditioning plots dialog added, courtesy of Richard Heiberger.
      
   o  Enhancements to 3D scatterplots.

   o  Small interface improvements (e.g., pressing letter key in a list box
moves to next entry starting with that letter).

   o  New Rcmdr options (etc and etcMenus) determine where the Commander
will look for its configuration and menu files (motivated by a suggestion by
Richard Heiberger).
      
Rcmdr version 1.2-0 includes revised Catalan and Japanese translations
(courtesy of Manel Salamero and Takaharu Araki); as other revised
translations become available, I'll submit updated versions of the package
to CRAN. Version 1.2-1 will also have a revised introductory manual.

As usual, bug reports, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package 'random' for non-deterministic random number
Message-ID: <17654.21522.980572.948491@basebud.nulle.part>


Dear useRs,

A few days ago, the initial version 0.1.0 of a new package 'random' was
uploaded to CRAN.

The random packages provides convenient access to the non-deterministic
random numbers provided by the random.org site created by Mads Haahr
(http://www.random.org).  

While certain hardware and software solutions that provide access to
non-deterministic random-numbers exist, few if any are portable across all
the hardware platforms R supports. Retrieving non-deterministic random
numbers may be beneficial to seed parallel simulations with independent
draws, to obtain portable initializations for other RNGs, to validate
simulation with non-deterministic RNGs, or simply for fun and
experimentations.

The package contains five simple functions 
     randomNumber	(random integeres between min, max w/ duplicates)
     randomSequence	(random sequences between min, max w/o duplicates)
     randomBytes	(in hex, dec, oct or bin)
     randomBufferStatus (to query the server status)
     sufficientBits	(boolean test of randomBufferStats vs rec'ed value)

Also included are two vignettes that can be accessed via
     vignette("random-intro", package = "random")
     vignette("random-essay", package = "random")

'random-intro' provides some background on the package as well as initial
test results using the dieharder suite by Robert G. Brown. I hope to expand
on these tests in the near future. 'random-essay' is a transcript of the web
essay at http://www.random.org/essay.html and provides some background on the
random.org service.

Some information is / will be at 
     http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/random.html will 

Comments or suggestions are more than welcome!

Regards, Dirk

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package ffmanova for 50-50 MANOVA released
Message-ID: <m0wt8pjajl.fsf@bar.nemo-project.org>

Version 0.1-0 of a new package `ffmanova' is now available on CRAN.

Comments, suggestions, etc. are welcome.  Please use the email address
ffmanova (at) mevik.net.

The package implements 50-50 MANOVA (Langsrud, 2002) with p-value
adjustment based on rotation testing (Langsrud, 2005).

The 50-50 MANOVA method is a modified variant of classical MANOVA made
to handle several highly correlated responses.  Classical MANOVA
performs poorly in such cases and it collapses when the number of
responses exceeds the number of observations.  The 50-50 MANOVA method
is suggested as a general method that will handle all types of data.
Principal component analysis is an integrated part of the algorithm.

The single response special case is ordinary general linear modeling.
Type II sums of squares are used to handle unbalanced designs
(Langsrud, 2003).  Furthermore, the Type II philosophy is extended to
continuous design variables.  This means that the method is invariant
to scale changes.  Centering of design variables is not needed.  The
Type II approach ensures that common pitfalls are avoided.

A univariate F-test p-value for each response can be reported when
several responses are present.  However, with a large number of
response variables, these results are questionable since we will
expect a lot of type I errors ("incorrect significance").  Therefore
the p-values need to be adjusted.

By using rotation testing it is possible to adjust the single response
p-values according to the familywise error rate criterion in an exact
and non-conservative (unlike Bonferroni) way.

It is also possible to adjust p-values according to a false discovery
rate criterion.  Our method is based on rotation testing and allows
any kind of dependence among the responses (Moen et al., 2005).

Note that rotation testing is closely related to permutation testing.
One difference is that rotation testing relies on the multinormal
assumption.  All the classical tests (t-test, F-test, Hotelling T^2
test, ...) can be viewed as special cases of rotation testing.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New forecasting bundle of packages
Message-ID: <44F9FB03.5050703@buseco.monash.edu.au>

v1.0 of the forecasting bundle of packages is now on CRAN and will 
propagate to mirrors shortly.

The forecasting bundle of R packages provides new forecasting methods, 
and graphical tools for displaying and analysing forecasts. It comprises 
the following packages:

     * forecast: Functions and methods for forecasting.

     * fma: All data sets from Makridakis, Wheelwright and Hyndman 
(1998)         Forecasting: methods and applications, Wiley & Sons: New 
York.

     * Mcomp: All data from the M1 and M3 forecast competitions.

Key features:

* a "forecast" method and class which can be applied to Arima, StructTS, 
HoltWinters and other time series models. This is preferred to predict() 
as it provides output in a consistent format (the "forecast" class) that 
can be used by other functions.

* automatic univariate time series forecasting based on exponential 
smoothing state space models. This is much more general and flexible 
than HoltWinters().

* automatic ARIMA forecasting based on minimizing the AIC or BIC.

* several new forecasting methods and time series graphics.

Some features of the forecast package were the subject of my talk at 
UseR! in Vienna in June. Slides of the talk are at 
http://www.robhyndman.info/talks/Hyndman_UseR.pdf

Anyone who has been using earlier versions of the packages from my web 
pages should check out the list of changes at 
http://www.robhyndman.info/Rlibrary/forecast/

Dear R-users,

I'd like to announce the release of the new version of package 'ltm' 
for analyzing multivariate dichotomous and polytomous data under the 
Item Response Theory approach.

New features:

* function tpm() (along with supporting methods, i.e., anova, plot, 
margins, factor.scores, etc.) has been added for fitting Birnbaum's 
Three Parameter Model.

* grm() can now handle mix of dichotomous and polytomous items.

* descript() returns more output, especially for dichotomous manifest 
variables.

For more details check the CHANGES file. Future plans include 
development of functions for goodness-of-fit, and the Partial Credit 
Model.

Any kind of feedback (questions, suggestions, bug-reports, etc.) is 
more than welcome.


Best,
Dimitris

Message-ID: <71257D09F114DA4A8E134DEAC70F25D3060D991B@groamrexm03.amer.pfizer.com>

Version 0.4.4 of odfWeave is available from CRAN. A Windows binary
should be available shortly.

This version requires base R version 2.3.1 or greater.

Changes from the last version include

  - Non-English character sets are handled better. For example, Chinese
characters can be included in R code. See the file "testCases.odt" in
the examples directory for an example

  - Image specifications, such as format and size, have been moved out
of odfWeaveControl. They are now controlled by the functions
getImageDefs and setImageDefs. This change allows the user to easily
modify the image properties in code chunks so that figures can have
different sizes or types throughout the document.

  - When odfWeave is invoked, a check for a zip program is done and a
more meaningful error is reported. This should help users better
understand the odfWeave software dependencies. 

  - A new XML parser was written so that users no longer need to turn
off the "size optimization" feature in OpenOffice. 

  - Three bugs were fixed:

    o If the user specified a relative path to the source file, an error
occurred

    o Fonts contained in the style definitions are automatically
registered in the ODF document. Previously, fonts that specified using
setStyleDefs but were not used in the document were ignored. Now, the
fonts found using getStyleDefs() at the start of odfWeave execution are
added to the document.

    o A new function, odfTmpDir, is now used to set the path to the
working directory. A new directory is created in the location of
tempdir().

As always, please send any comments, suggestions or bug reports to
max.kuhn at pfizer.com.

Subject: [R-pkgs] cairoDevice 1.2 on CRAN
Message-ID: <451287F7.90200@iastate.edu>

The cairoDevice package has recently been released on CRAN. cairoDevice 
is an R graphics device based on the cairo 
(http://www.cairographics.org) vector graphics library. It is 
distinguished from many other devices in its ability to render high 
quality anti-aliased graphics. It is available on all three major 
platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux) and requires the GTK+ 2.8.0 library 
and its dependencies. For the current users, version 1.2 fixes many bugs.

cairoDevice is capable of rendering in three different ways: to the 
screen inside a GTK+ window, to an arbitrary GtkDrawingArea that is part 
of an RGtk2 GUI, or to any GdkDrawable, allowing for example the output 
of png and jpg images derived from R graphics using the GdkPixbuf 
bindings from RGtk2.

cairoDevice is interactive in that it supports the locator tool as well 
as the getGraphicsEvent() functionality, which previously was available 
only from the Windows device.

To obtain the requisite GTK+ (>= 2.8.0) libraries:

Windows: Download and run the installer from http://gladewin32.sf.net.
Mac: DarwinPorts
Linux: packages from your distribution

Please enjoy the package and let me know if you have any problems,

Michael Lawrence

Reshape version 0.7.1
=====================

Reshape is an R package for flexibly restructuring and aggregating
data.  It's inspired by Excel's pivot tables, and it (hopefully) makes
it very easy to get your data into the shape that you want.  You can find out
more at http://had.co.nz/reshape

What's new in this version?

 * A 25 page introductory vignette, also available at
http://had.co.nz/reshape/introduction.pdf, which shows some of the
many ways that you can use reshape.

 * The biggest change is that reshape now outputs regular data.frames,
which should make it easier to use them for further analysis and
transformation.

 * Added a fill argument to cast which specifies what value should be
used for structural missings

Various bug fixes and completion missing features:

 * fun.aggregate will always be applied if specified, even if no
aggregation occurs

 * margins now work for non-aggregated data

 * cast now accepts a list of functions for fun.aggregate

 * very long formulas will now work in cast

 * fixed bug in rbind.fill

 * should be able to melt any cast form

Please let me know if you have any comments, questions, or something
isn't working right.

Hadley

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package 'ade4TkGUI', a Tcl/Tk GUI for ade4
Message-ID: <p06210200c143e92a3943@[10.0.1.5]>

Dear R-Users,

ade4TkGUI is a new package available on CRAN. It implements a Tcl/Tk
graphical user interface (GUI) for the ade4 package.

Only the most basic functions of ade4 have a GUI in this first
version : classical one-table data analysis methods (PCA, COA,
MCA, PCO, etc.), one table with groups of rows (BGA, WGA, DA),
and two-tables analysis methods (Coinertia analysis, CCA, PCAIV).
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/JTHome/ade4TkGUI.jpg

One of the benefits of using ade4TkGUI is the centralized graphical
display of the dudi objects created by ade4. A dudi is a list with
many components http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/ade4html/dudi.html
The GUI presents a window in which the user can click on dudi
components to get predefined graphical displays : 
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/JTHome/coa1dudi.jpg

Another benefit is for complex functions, and particularly graphical
functions that have many parameters. For example, the s.class function
has 27 parameters : http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/ade4html/s.class.html
In this case, the GUI makes it much easier to try various graphical
options : http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/JTHome/s.class.jpg

ade4TkGUI also contains a factor map exploration function, written by
Stephane Dray. This function allows dynamic operations like zooming,
panning, and identification of points by searching on labels on the
factor maps : http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/JTHome/explore.jpg

Current version (ade4TkGUI_0.1-4) depends on ade4_1.4-2, and the
dynamic factor map exploration function depends on tkrplot. Future
versions will add GUIs for more advanced ade4 methods, like ktables
analysis methods, or spatial methods, and for more graphical functions.

All comments are welcome. Please use the adelist mailing list :

Subject: [R-pkgs] New versions of Matrix and lme4 packages for R-2.4.0
Message-ID: <40e66e0b0610030756j7f966eb9k8ab90c9daf047580@mail.gmail.com>

Versions 0.9975-1 of the Matrix and lme4 packages will soon be available on
CRAN for use with R version 2.4.0 or later.

Purpose of the packages:

The Matrix package provides S4 classes and methods for sparse
and dense matrices.  The lme4 package provides functions for fitting
and assessing linear or generalized linear mixed effects models (also
called multilevel models).  Like the Matrix package, the lme4 package
uses S4 classes and methods.

Features of this release:

- These package versions are designed for use with release 2.4.0 or
 later of R.  Because of enhancements in S4 classes and methods in
 R-2.4.0 the packages load much faster than before and the functions
 can be organized differently.  In particular, the lmer function for
 fitting linear or generalized linear models is again in the lme4
 package. The C code of lme4 now calls C code that is exported from Matrix

Matrix package improvements:

- The  Matrix() constructor function has become more versatile and you
  are advised to read the help page and try its examples.

- Reorganization and simplification of source code (source package is
  about 1/3 the previous size).  Much greater use of virtual classes
  in method definitions.

- LU and QR decompositions for sparse matrices using the CSparse
  library of C functions written by Tim Davis and documented in his
  2006 SIAM book "Direct Methods for Sparse Linear Systems".  New
  function Cholesky (in addition to function chol) that allows the
  full range of CHOLMOD library options for sparse Cholesky
  decompositions.

- New classes to distinguish between sparse logical matrices and
  sparse pattern matrices.

- NAs are now properly dealt with in sparse and dense matrices.

- Printing of sparse matrices now distinguishes structural zeros and
  values that can be nonzero but happen to be equal to zero.

- New functions triu, tril and band patterned after those in Octave
  and Matlab.

lme4 package improvements:

- Allow specification of nested random effects using terms of the form
 (1|block/field)

- Model specifications without fixed effects, such as travel ~ (1|Rail),
  are allowed.  Previously the implicit intercept term needed to be
  explicitly specified as travel ~ 1 + (1 | Rail).

- Error declared when the number of levels of a grouping factor is not
   less than the number of observations.

- Default estimation method for GLMMs is now optimization of the
  Laplace approximation to the log-likelihood

- Reorganization and simplification of source code.  Allow for models,
  such as multilevel item response theory models or models with
  carry-over of teacher effects, that extend the linear or generalized
  linear mixed model.

- Fixed bug, reported by Goran Brostrom, in calculation of standard
  errors of coefficients in a binomial GLMM where the response is
  given as a matrix.

Dear R users,

The package proptest (http://www.davidkraus.net/proptest/) has been
recently released to CRAN.

The package provides functions for testing the proportional hazards
assumption in the Cox model for right censored survival data. Two types of
tests for identifying nonproportional covariates are implemented:

Ryacas is an R interface to the free yacas computer algebra
system.  Ryacas allows one to send R expressions,
unprocessed yacas strings and certain other R objects to a
separate yacas process from R and get back the result.  It
also has facilities for manipulating yacas strings and R
expressions destined for yacas processing.

It can be used for exact arithmetic, symbolic math, ASCII
pretty printing and translating R to TeX.


Online info.  For overview, pointers to additional
information, installation instructions and a sample session

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0610240835150.16003@imbe153.imbe.med.uni-erlangen.de>


Dear useRs,

`multcomp' version 0.991-1 will be shortly available from 
CRAN near you. Nearly all functionality contained in the
package has been re-implemented from scratch.

The focus of the package has been extended to general linear
hypotheses in arbitrary parametric models and the most important
function to check out is `glht()'. Multiple comparison of
means procedures (for example Tukey all-pair comparisons)
are contained in the framework as special cases.

The old user interface (functions `simint()' and `simtest()') are still
available, however deprecated, and the presentation of their output 
differs from older versions of `multcomp'.

As always, feedback, feature requests and bug reports are more than 
welcome.

Best wishes,

Torsten

A new version of package 'portfolio' is now available on CRAN.  Also
available are new packages 'backtest', for basic spread-based
hypothesis testing, and 'portfolioSim', a general framework for
portfolio simulation.

Last March we wrote R-packages regarding our desire to build a suite
of tools for portfolio analytics in R:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-packages/2006/000171.html

Since then we've made progress by improving 'portfolio' and adding two
new packages, but are still looking for collaborators who would like
to help design, build, and test this set of tools.  We hope to make
the same amount of progress in 2007 as we have in 2006.

As always, comments on design, usefulness, or any aspect of these
packages is much appreciated.

Subject: [R-pkgs] X2R: R-compatible output routines from C, ADMB,
	Fortran to R
Message-ID: <453E24BA.2000300@noaa.gov>

We announce the availability of three related software libraries: C2R, 
ADMB2R, and For2R (together, X2R). Each contains output routines to 
simplify transfer of complicated data structures from models written in 
a compiled language to R.  The user's data can be written as a 
structured ASCII file which, when read by R (note 1) with a single 
dget() function call, will become an R data object of type list. The 
list, of course, may contain components such as data frames, matrices, 
and other lists.

These are NOT R packages; rather they are subroutine libraries to be 
used with programmers' own modeling codes.  Limited testing indicates 
that they are compatible with S-PLUS, as well (note 1, note 2).

Languages supported are Fortran 95 (with For2R), C and C++ (with C2R) 
and AD Model Builder (with ADMB2R) (note 1, note 3).  Source code and 
users' manuals are supplied. 

For those working in fish stock assessment, we anticipate releasing soon 
a related group of R functions, FishGraph.  The FishGraph functions 
create graphs useful in analysis of fisheries stock assessments whose 
output has been saved with X2R.  We have been using FishGraph for 
several years and are now completing the documentation.

This work has been tested and used by the authors. However, any software 
may contain bugs, and these works are classified by NOAA as  
"Experimental Products."  Although the software is supplied with no 
warranty whatsoever, bug reports, suggestions, and extensions are 
solicited (send to Prager or Martin).  The authors will attempt to fix 
all bugs promptly and to add requested features.

Software is now available at CRAN,  http://cran.r-project.org/ , and is 
expected to propagate to mirrors shortly.  Look under "Software / Other" 
for the current X2R distribution.

Dear all,

I have just uploaded to CRAN the version 1.5 of the
package 'adehabitat'. Significant changes are
listed below:

* the package now contains a new function allowing a factorial 
decomposition of the Mahalanobis distances in habitat selection studies, 
named madifa().

* The ENFA can now be performed using all kinds of variables (numeric, 
factors, fuzzy, mixing of several types, etc.)

* Several methods allowing the analysis of animals movements have been 
added, including the first passage time (function fpt()), a 
rediscretization algorithm (redisltraj()), and an interactive graphic 
window for dynamic analysis (trajdyn())

* A function for interactive exploration of maps of class "kasc" has 
been added (explore.kasc)

* Scott Fortmann-Roe (Univ. Berkeley) programmed a better algorithm for 
Nearest neighbour Convex hull home range estimation.

* The function kasc2spixdf() have been updated


Happy testing,

Message-ID: <eb555e660610302010y5d39e4el4db81591ea13ae0@mail.gmail.com>

CRAN now has a package called rcompletion that attempts to provide TAB
completion for R using the GNU readline library, intended for R
sessions run from a command line. From the package help page:

Description:

    This package provides pseudo-intelligent TAB completion for a
    readline enabled instance of R when it is run from a terminal (or
    more specifically, an interface which uses readline to accept user
    input). It has no effect on the various GUI interfaces to R,
    including ESS and the standard Windows interface.

The package does not compile on a standard Windows box, and there is
no Windows binary available for it. For more usage details, install
and load the package, then type

package?rcompletion

at the R prompt. The manual is also available online at

http://cran.r-project.org/doc/packages/rcompletion.pdf


Notes:

To install and use the package successfully, you need:

(1) R compiled with readline, and run with readline enabled

(2) the rcompletion package compiled with readline

The rcompletion package comes with a configure script that tries to
detect readline on the system and aborts if it is unsuccessful in
doing so. There have been no reports so far of false positives (i.e.
detecting readline when it shouldn't). However, there are known cases
of false negatives, i.e. installation failing when it shouldn't. If
this happens to you, any information you can provide to help resolve
the problem would be appreciated.

If step (2) appears to be successful but (1) is not true (e.g. R is
run with --no-readline), nothing bad (but nothing good either) should
happen.

Just a quick follow-up. Thanks to Simon Urbanek and hints from
Alexandre Aguiar, CRAN now has a version (0.0-10) of rcompletion that
should work on more systems. If it still doesn't work when you think
it should, please let me know.

	for	mixed datatypes
Message-ID: <1164396364.4185.42.camel@pc-racine1.economics.mcmaster.ca>

Dear R users,

A new package titled `np' is now available from CRAN.

The package implements recently developed kernel methods that seamlessly
handle the mix of continuous, unordered, and ordered factor datatypes
often found in applied settings. 

The package also allows users to create their own
nonparametric/semiparametric routines using high-level function calls
(via the function npksum()) rather than writing their own C or Fortran
code. Much of the code underlying the package is written in C including
the function npksum().

Currently, a range of methods can be found in the package including

- multivariate nonparametric unconditional and conditional density
estimation

- multivariate nonparametric conditional mean and gradient estimation
(local constant and local linear)

- multivariate nonparametric conditional distribution, quantile and
gradient estimation 

- nonparametric model specification tests for testing correctness of
parametric regression models

- nonparametric significance tests for nonparametric regression

- semiparametric multivariate regression methods (partially linear,
index models, average derivative estimation, varying/smooth coefficient
models)

A function npplot() is implemented that allows users to visualize the
resulting objects.

A variety of methods for computing standard errors and error bounds are
implemented including asymptotic and resampling-based methods (the
latter employing the `boot' package which is required).

A range of examples can be found in the examples section of the
accompanying help files.

We caution potential users that multivariate data-driven bandwidth
selection methods can be numerically intensive. For this reason we are
now using some of the functionality contained in the Rmpi package to
develop an MPI-aware version of the np package that we have tentatively
titled the `npRmpi' package.

The np package implements a number of methods found in the newly
released publication by Li and Racine (2007) titled Nonparametric
Econometrics: Theory and Practice, Princeton University Press.

See press.princeton.edu/titles/8355.html for further details.

Best regards, Jeff.

               novelty detection and regression

 o kpca() : Kernel Pricipal Components Analysis

 o kcca() : Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis

 o kfa() : Kernel Feature Analysis

 o sigest() : Hyperparameter estimation for the Gaussian and the Laplacian kernels

 o inchol() : Incomplete Cholesky decomposition method

 o csi() : Cholesky decomposition with side information

 o ipop() : Interior point-based Quadratic Optimizer

Kernlab also includes a range of functions enabling the easy implementation of
new kernel methods including functions for computing commonly used kernel
expressions (e.g. kernel matrix, kernel expansion, etc.) and
implementations of nine kernels (e.g. Linear, Gaussian, Polynomial,
Sigmoid, Laplace, String kernels, etc.) which can be used with any of the
functions included in the package.
Ready computed kernel matrices and user defined kernel functions can also
be used.

kernlab is based on the S4 object model.
A vignette describing a large portion of the functions and features is
included.

Message-ID: <4576E007.80308@yahoo.com>

Dear useRs,

Please find the new package mFilter version 0.1-2 on CRAN.

The package implements several time series filters useful for smoothing
and extracting trend and cyclical components of a time series. The
routines are commonly used in economics and finance, however they should
also be interest to other areas. Currently, Christiano-Fitzgerald,
Baxter-King, Hodrick-Prescott, Butterworth, and trigonometric regression
filters are included in the package.

Message-ID: <f8e6ff050612060947n43afd3ffifb33e064a89fc21d@mail.gmail.com>

We are pleased to announce version 2.1.4-3 of rggobi. This release
introduces many new features, including the ability to open new
displays, and get and set tour projections.

The rggobi package provides a command-line interface to GGobi, an
interactive and dynamic graphics package. Rggobi complements GGobi's
graphical user interface, providing a way to fluidly transition
between analysis and exploration, as well as automating common tasks.
It builds on the first version of rggobi to provide a more robust and
user friendly interface.

To install rggobi, you will need to first install GGobi by following
the instructions at http://www.ggobi.org/downloads/.  You get more
details, including an introductory vignette, at
http://www.ggobi.org/rggobi/.

There are some problems with rggobi on Intel Macs (we are working on a
solution), so please email me for more details if you are keen to try
it out.  We want rggobi to be a stable and useful tool, so please do
not hesitate to email me or the GGobi mailing list
(http://www.ggobi.org/support/) if you have any problems.

Regards,

Hadley

Message-ID: <f8e6ff050612060948g3fa18226pc2db548e477e1481@mail.gmail.com>

The classifly package uses rggobi to visualise classification
boundaries in high-dimensions.  Given p-dimensional training data
containing d groups (the design space), a classification algorithm
(classifier) predicts which group new data belongs to. Generally the
input to these algorithms is high dimensional, and the boundaries
between groups will be high dimensional and perhaps curvilinear or
multi-facted. This R package provides methods for visualising the
division of space between the groups.

More information and a paper describing the ideas can be found at
http://had.co.nz/classifly/.

Hadley

 Hello,

 The 'trip' package provides extensions to the 'sp' spatial classes for 
animal track data.

 Trip objects are created from SpatialPointsDataFrame objects by 
specifying the columns containing ID and date-time data. Argos formats 
can be read directly, and there are functions for basic speed filtering 
and spatial gridding of time spent. Tight integration with 'sp' means 
that projections and general I/O can be handled using 'rgdal'. (This 
really is excellent and so I thank the developers of these and 
supporting packages).

Trip is intended for use with location data that are irregularly spaced 
in time - this contrasts with the rationale behind the traj class in 
'adehabitat'. Primarily it has been developed with marine animal data in 
mind, but the validation of trip classes used should general for many 
applications.

 There is a short vignette available from here -  it's not integrated 
into the CRAN-available package yet.

Subject: [R-pkgs] new gstat version
Message-ID: <43C3AA44.4000303@geog.uu.nl>

Soon on CRAN a new version of package gstat will emerge, which
has a few minor changes and possible incompatibilities w.r.t. the
previous version(s).

The new gstat (0.9-23) now:
+ depends on sp, and uses internally with Spatial* classes from sp
   if data are provided in the old-fashoned way (as data.frame)
+ has a vignette to get you started with the classes in sp
+ defines krige as a generic; two typical uses are:

# "old-style", using data.frame's:
library(gstat)
data(meuse)
data(meuse.grid)
v = vgm(0.6, "Sph", 900, 0.1) # spherical variogram model
zn.kri1 = krige(log(zinc)~1, ~x+y, meuse, meuse.grid, v)
image(zn.kri1)

# "new-style", using SpatialPointsDataFrame's:
coordinates(meuse) = c("x", "y") # promote meuse to SpatialPointsDataFrame
coordinates(meuse.grid) = c("x", "y") # promote to SpatialPointsDataFrame
gridded(meuse.grid) = TRUE # promote to SpatialPixelsDataFrame
zn.kri2 = krige(log(zinc)~1, meuse, meuse.grid, v)
spplot(zn.kri2[1])

+ provides a generic idw for inverse distance interpolation
(calling sequence identical to krige)

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:
  the krige generic is

     krige(formula, locations, ...)

  based on the class of argument 2 (locations) either of the two
  versions (see above) is called. This means that no named argument
  "data" should be passed in case locations is missing (i.e., when
  data is of class SpatialPointsDataFrame). Instead, pass it as
  argument 2 or as named argument "locations".

Message-ID: <40e66e0b0601101236u61c7c269u9c1bea16cb532867@mail.gmail.com>

This is a "heads up" to those using the lmer function for fitting
linear mixed models or generalized linear mixed models.  In the next
few days Martin and I will upload a new version of the Matrix package
that employs a new representation of linear mixed models based on the
supernodal Cholesky factorization provided by Tim Davis's CHOLMOD
library of sparse matrix code.

This representation will be incompatible with the current
representation, which uses a class of blocked compressed sparse
matrices called the dBCMatrix class.  If you have an lmer object
created with the current code you will need to convert it to use it
with the new package.  By far the easiest way to do this is to
recreate it.  (The new code is very fast.)  However, we will also
offer a conversion function for those who no longer have the
information used to produce the model fit.

So the takehome message is that if you are currently using lmer then
you should save the information used to fit a model in addition to
saving the fitted model.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package lspls
Message-ID: <m0lkxgp93a.fsf@bar.nemo-project.org>

Dear R useRs,

A new package `lspls' is now available on CRAN.  It implements the
LS-PLS (least squares--partial least squares) regression method,
described in for instance

J?rgensen, K., Segtnan, V. H., Thyholt, K., N?s, T. (2004) A Comparison of
Methods for Analysing Regression Models with Both Spectral and Designed
Variables; Journal of Chemometrics 18(10), 451--464.

The current version of the package (0.1-0) should probably be
considered `alpha software'.  Nothing is cast in iron yet, and
especially the formula interface and internal structure are apt to
change in future versions.  The software should, however, be fully
usable in its present form.

`lspls' currently includes fit and cross-validation functions with
formula interfaces, a predict method, and plots of scores, loadings
and (R)MSEP values.

Suggestions, bug reports and other comments are very welcome.

RGtk2 offers virtually complete bindings to the latest GTK, as well as 
some of its dependencies, including Cairo and Pango, and some extras 
like libglade and GtkMozEmbed (on Linux). Almost the entire package was 
documented by transforming the original (C language oriented) API 
documentation to the R perspective.

Please see the following website for details and downloads: 
http://www.ggobi.org/rgtk2.

You'll also find the Cairo R graphics device there, which lets you 
display R graphics within your RGtk2 GUI.

Please send any bug reports to me.

Message-ID: <20060207003936.CDLZ8316.tomts20-srv.bellnexxia.net@JohnDesktop8300>

Dear R-packages list members,

Last month, Peter Muhlberger posted a message to the r-help list that
suggested, among other things, a desire for a more convenient method of
performing Wald tests for statistical models fit in R. 

Thanks largely to Achim Zeleis's help, the linear.hypothesis function in the
car package has been reworked so that (1) it is applicable to any model
object that responds to the generic coef() and vcov() functions (along with
specific methods for lm and glm objects); and (2) permits symbolic
specification of hypotheses as linear equations in the named parameters of
the model. I'd be particularly interested in people's reactions to the new
interface and to learn of any problems that arise

The new version 1.1-0 of the car package (with some other, less significant
changes and additions) is now on CRAN.

Regards,
 John

Reshape version 0.6
===================

Reshape is an R package for flexibly restructuring and aggregating
data.  It's inspired by Excel's pivot tables, and it (hopefully) makes
it very easy to get your data into the shape that you want.  You can find out
more at http://had.co.nz/reshape

What's new in this version?

 * a new function, stamp, which is kind of a cross between by and
cast, and allows for aggregation functions that take an entire data
frame.  See ?stamp for examples

 * deals better with row and column names when subsetting the result

 * a namespace to make it easier to deal with potential name clashes
with other packages

 * better performance

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Message-ID: <43FD7176.8040403@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr>

Dear all,

I have just uploaded to CRAN the version 1.4 of the
package 'adehabitat'. Significant changes are
listed below:

- The eigenanalysis of selection ratios (Calenge and Dufour, 2006, Ecology)
  can now be performed using the function eisera(). It can be used for 
the analysis of
  habitat selection when habitat can be considered to consist of several 
habitat types
  (e.g. vegetation types).

- A new class, the class "ltraj", is now available for the analysis of 
trajectories of animals
  (e.g. for the analysis of data collected using GPS collars). This 
class automatically
  computes the turning angles between successive moves, the absolute 
angles for each move,
  the speeds and the net squared displacement for each relocation. This 
class is to be
  prefered to the class "traj". The class "traj" is now deprecated.
  Note that the data set "puechcirc" is now of the class ltraj.

- The functions making the interface with the package "sp" have been 
updated: 'area2spol'
   converts an object of class 'area' into an object of class 
'SpatialPolygons'. 'spol2area' converts
   an object of class 'SpatialPolygons' or 'SpatialPolygonsDataFrame' 
into an object of class 'area'.
   'attpol2area' gets the data attribute of an object of class 
'SpatialPolygonsDataFrame'
   and stores is into a data frame. 'traj2spdf' converts an object of 
class 'traj' into an object of
   class 'SpatialPointsDataFrame'. 'traj2sldf' converts an object of 
class 'traj' into an object of
   class 'SpatialLinesDataFrame'.

- The function enfa() has been modified:
   The old components "co" and "l1" have been removed from objects of 
class "enfa", as they did not rely
   on solid mathematical theory. The old component "c1" is now named 
"co", and corresponds to
   the scores of habitat variables in the enfa (the squared norm of this 
vector is equal to 1 for
   the identity metric). As previously, the component "li" stores the 
scores of the resource units
   in the ENFA.

- The function df2kasc now accept objects of class "kasc" with one column.

- That's all, thanks for reading !

Questions, comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.
Happy testing,

Version 1.2-0 of the pls package is now available on CRAN.

The pls package implements partial least squares regression (PLSR) and
principal component regression (PCR).  Features of the package include

- Several plsr algorithms: orthogonal scores, kernel pls and simpls
- Flexible cross-validation
- A formula interface, with traditional methods like predict, coef,
  plot and summary
- Functions for extraction of scores and loadings, and calculation of
  (R)MSEP and R2
- A simple multiplicative scatter correction (msc) implementation
- Functions for plotting predictions, validation statistics,
  coefficients, scores, loadings, biplots and correlation loadings.

The main changes since 1.1-0 are

- predict() now handles missing data like the `lm' method does (the
  default is to predict `NA').
- fitted() and residuals() now return NA for observations with missing
  values, if na.action is na.exclude.
- `ncomp' is now reduced when it is too large for the requested 
  cross-validation.
- Line plot parameter arguments have been added to predplotXy(), so
  one can control the properties of the target line in predplot().
- MSEP(), RMSEP(), loadings(), loadingplot() and scoreplot() are now
  generic.

   o  `mob', an object-oriented implementation of a recently suggested

       Hornik, 2005) has been added. It works out of the box for partitioning
       (generalized) linear regression models, others can be easily plugged
       in. A new vignette "MOB" describes the implementation ideas and
       provides a few examples with nice plots.

   o  `cforest', an implementation of Breiman's random forest ensemble
       algorithm based on conditional inference trees (`ctree') has been
       added and can be used to analyse censored data and weighted
       problems.

Moreover, some minor issues have been addressed and are documented in the 
CHANGES file.

Best wishes,

Torsten, Kurt and Achim.

Message-ID: <17414.25456.301349.40942@basebud.nulle.part>


[ I hope this is not considered off-topic for the list: 

  A new Quantian release was just announced, and it contains even more R.
  As before, we have R (now 2.2.1), ESS, Ggobi, Rpy, several BioInfo tools 
  -- but now we also have RSPerl, JGR, rJava and more.  A full sync to CRAN
  and BioC as of Feb 25, 2006 now yields   dim(installed.packages())[1] 
  of 877.    Feedback welcome, but preferably on the quantian-general
  lists (which requires subscriptions to keep the spammers out). 

  The original announcement is below. I also welcome careful forwarding
  to other audiences or communities I may not reach.

(Please see note [1] below regarding recipients for this posting. Thanks!)


Executive Summary: 

    Quantian 0.7.9.2 is the second Quantian release based on Knoppix 4.0.2.
    Quantian adds hundreds of scientific / numeric packages, as well as the
    an openMosix enabled 2.4.27 kernel, to the cdrom version of Knoppix. 
    Version 0.7.9.2 ships as one compressed iso file of 2.7gb that is
    
    Relative to the previous release 0.7.9.1, several small bugs have been 
    fixed, Sun's Java 1.5.0 SDK has been added along with several Java-based
    applications (ImageJ, Weka, JGR, Mondrian), several other applications
    have been added, yet more R packages from CRAN and BioC are included and
    a few other packages have been updated.
    
    Quantian now contains over 2550 Debian packages, over 870 packages
    for R and a few extra applications.

    Quantian comes as one bootable dvd iso of 2.85 gb (compressed) with
    over 7.6 gb (uncompressed) of software of interest to quantitative 
    analysists, scientists, researchers or students.


Announcing Quantian release 0.7.9.2
===================================


I   What is it?

    Quantian is a remastering of Knoppix, the self-configuring and directly
    bootable cdrom/dvd that turns any pc or laptop into a full-featured Linux
    workstation, and (parts of) clusterKnoppix, which adds support for
    openMosix-based  cluster computing. However, Quantian differs from
    Knoppix by having a particular focus on quantitative, numerical or 
    scientific applications, and hence adds a very large set of programs of
    interest to applied or theoretical workers in quantitative or data-driven
    fields to the solid base provided by Knoppix..  

    See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian.html for more details.

    
II What Quantian highlights should I care about ?

    o Second release based on Knoppix 4.0.2: Derived from the cdrom version of
      Knoppix, Quantian utilises the unionfs setup of Knoppix to combine two
      compressed loop images for a total of 2.85 gb (from two files of 1.66 gb
      and 1.19 gb) corresponding to over 7.6 gb of software.

    o KDE 3.4/3.5, Kernel 2.6.12; added backport of kernel 2.4.27 with
      openMosix patch for continued openMosix support including unionfs
      support (that was missing in 0.7.9.1)

    o Some highlights in 0.7.9.2 are

      - Java support via the 'Java 1.5.0' SDK from Sun, installed via
        the packages from www.debian-unofficial.org; this allowed us to
	add ImageJ, Weka, Mondrian and JGR.
      
      - some other packages that were added: celestia, cervisia, gcj,
        gnuhtml2latex, inkscape, octplot, oprofile, prospect, praat, rserve,
	wxmaxima, xalan, (x)orsa as well as many library additions/upgrades

      - even more complete R support with 877 packages (25 from 'core R',
        another 76 from Debian packages, and 779 directly installed from CRAN
        and BioConductor, covering over 99% of all packages at CRAN and
        BioConductor [ not counting a handful of windows-only CRAN packages]
        for complete coverage as of 25 Feb 2006), ESS editing in Emacs /
        XEmacs, GGobi visualization, Rpad webinterface, the award winning JGR
        'Java GUI for R', RSPerl, Rserve, an early release of the RKward GUI
        and more.

      - continued strong bioinformatics/biology support:
        BioConductor, arb, biofox, bioperl, biopython, blast2, boxshade,
        bugsx, clustalw, fastdnaml, fastlink, garlic, gromacs, hmmer, loki,
        mipe, molphy, muscle, ncbi, phylip, rasmol, readseq, seaview,
        t-coffee, textopo, ImageJ, and more;

      - continued strong mathematics / computational algrebra support: axiom,
        blacs, calc, euler, gap, giac, mathomatic, maxima, pari, scalapack,
        scilab, texmacs, yacas, yorick;

      - continued strong visualization / graphics support: dx, garlic, gdpc,
        gnuplot, grace, grass, gri, illuminator, kst, labplot, mayavi,
        matplot, proj, plplot, plotmtv, rasmol, starplot, vtk, xd3d, xgraph,
        ygraph;  
 
      - large number of programming and scripting languages, editors, 
        debuggers and libraries;

      - excellent latex support with auctex, lyx, kile, texmacs interface,
        as well as numerous macro packages, bibtex tools;

      - office support via openoffice and koffice suites, abiword, gnumeric
        and other applications;

      - plus all the tools and toys from the current Knoppix relase.

    o See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/changelog.html for details.

    o See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/howto.html for several
      short HOWTOs on booting Quantian from hd on either Windows or Linux,
      booting via a bootcd (such as clusterKnoppix), or botting from a 
      USB memory device.  Contributions, corrections, and feedback on these
      HOWTOs is always appreciated.


III Where do I get it?

    o Downloads are available from the main host at Seattle at FHCRC:

            http://quantian.fhcrc.org/
	    rsync://quantian.fhcrc.org/quantian/
      
      and at the East Coast at 

            http://research.warnes.net/downloads/quantian/CURRENT/
	    ftp://research.warnes.net/users/edd/quantian/CURRENT/

      The most recent release is also available at

            http://quantian.alioth.debian.org/

      Note that file size of 2.75 gb may upset web caching system such
      as squid. It may be prudent to rely on rsync or bittorrent instead
      of http.

    o Bittorrents should be available shortly at

            http://www.tlm-project.org/public/distributions/quantian/

    o The main European mirrors should catch up shortly:

            http://sunsite.rediris.es/mirror/quantian

            http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/ftp/pub/Linux/quantian

    o CD/DVD vendors will probably update their offerings soon as well. 
      See the Quantian site for a list.


IV  Mailing lists

    o Two mailing lists exist for Quantian

        quantian-announce	  for announcements, intended to be low volume
        quantian-general	  for general discussions about Quantian

      available via

	http://alioth.debian.org/mail/?group_id=30303

      for subscription info etc., and start using the quantian-general lists
      for general questions, comments, suggestions or discussions about 
      Quantian.

      Quantian-general is subscribed to quantian-announce, so you only need
      to subscribe to one (but can of course subscribe to both).  Posting to
      quantian-general requires a subscription. 

      Reply-To: for this message is quantian-general at lists.alioth.debian.org
      so that discussions can be continued on the list.


V   Bugs fixed from 0.7.9.1

    o The missing default boot option for isolinux has been added, simply
      pressing return at the boot prompt (or waiting) now yields kernel 2.6.

    o Marco Caliari figured out how to add unionfs support to Kernel 2.4.27,
      so we now have openMosix support with the full 7.5 gb of software!

    o Progress from Debian's C++ transition allowed us to update many KDE
      packages, including kdvi. KDE is in parts updates to release 3.5, some
      applications are still from release 3.4. Several other applications
      that were uninstallable in 0.7.9.1 because of C++ library conflicts
      (celestia, gdal) are now included.
     

VI  Known Bugs in 0.7.9.2

    o Only under kernel 2.4.27, kdesktop comes up with an error message
      that needs to be acknowledged. Konsole then has a broken color schema.
      Simply selecting a working schema, and manually running kdesktop fixes
      this.

    o No other issue as of 28 Feb 2006. Please report anything you notice
      to the quantian-general mailing list.


VII Other items

    o Feedback / poll on package additions or removal

      As always, I welcome comments and suggestions about programs to be
      added or removed. Existing Debian packages, and possibly existing
      rpm packages, typically get inserted quite readily.

      Please send feedback, questions, comments, ... to the 
      
	quantian-general at lists.alioth.debian.org

      list to maximise the number of eyes glancing at any one question.
      Notice that a subscription to the list is needed in order to post.

    o Feedback would also be appreciated on ways to better communicate with
      difference scientific communities that could be interested in Quantian.


VIII Notes

    [1] This email is sent via the quantian-announce mailing list. I have
        subscribed those whose email addresses are in my quantian mail folder 
        due to prior emails. The quantian-announce mailing list only sends
        moderator-approved posts -- so there should be no spam whatsoever. 
        Anybody who considers this unwanted is kindly asked to send me
        a private mail to get unsubscribed immediately.


Best regards,  Dirk

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package 'portfolio'
Message-ID: <17420.32154.96149.92683@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

We would like to announce the availability of the 'portfolio' package
in R for analysing equity portfolios.  Version 0.2-0 is now available
on CRAN.  To take a look, you can:

> install.packages("portfolio")
...
> vignette("portfolio")

and play around. Those who would just like to check out an
introduction can simply look at:

http://www.kanecap.com/R/portfolio/portfolio.pdf

This is the first, very rough version of a package that we hope to
build and extend over the coming months. Our ambitions for this
project are not small. Hundreds of professionals around the world use
R for portfolio analysis but, right now, we all use our own individual
tools for doing so. That seems a shame.

Of course, one reason for the lack of cooperation is that finance is
largely a zero sum game. Every dollar that we make is a dollar that
someone else loses. But, at least when it comes to analysis tools
(rather than alpha generation). This conflict does not seem
insurmountable. We will see.

So, consider this e-mail a call for comment and cooperation. Are there
others out there who would be interested in using this package? Are
there others willing to contribute, if only in terms of bug fixes,
test cases, documentation and the like? Please let us know and, in
fact, let the whole list know.

By releasing a rough version of the package, we are especially
interested in recruiting other developers to the project. None of our
design decisions are set in stone. Serious offers to contribute will
earn a significant say in future development.

Hi,

I recently uploaded a package called "calibrate" to CRAN. This
package contains routines for the calibration of (oblique) axes
in biplots and scatter plots. Documentation provides examples
for ordinary scatter plots with additional axes, biplots from
principal component analysis, correspondence analysis,
canonical correlation analysis and redundancy analysis.

Message-ID: <20060312195513.GA14923@sfu.ca>

Version 0.2 of the package LDheatmap is now on CRAN. The main function 
LDheatmap produces a graphical display, as a heat map, of measures of 
pairwise linkage disequilibria between SNPs. Users may optionally 
include the physical locations or genetic map distances of each SNP on 
the plot.

The revisions to the package are aimed at improving the user's ability 
to modify and annotate the heatmap. Most notably, LDheatmap is now based 
on grid graphics. Examples of how to modify the plot using tools from 
the grid package are included in the LDheatmap help file.

Dear R users,

a new release (v1.5) of Spectrino package is on CRAN.

For those of you not familiar with Spectrino:
Spectrino is a spectra preparation utility for R. It has specialized 
organization and visualization features for spectra. Spectrino has visual 
interface - as Windows application with rich set of features to set a 
structure and manipulate visually spectra and it is accessible from R as a 
library with a set of commands for saving and selective extraction of 
spectral data.

more info at http://www.spectrino.com

For all Spectrino users:
The new in version 1.5:
  - minor bugs fixed.
  - some visual interface improvements.
  - now, the pre-processing options are adjustable from within R - function 
spnPPOpt(opts)
  - the mean extraction is based on a specific group (not on the entire 
set) - more appropriate for discriminant analysis.

Enjoy the new Spectrino !

Dear R-users,

I'd like to announce the new version of package 'ltm' for Item 
Response Theory analysis. The function grm() (along with supporting 
methods, i.e., anova, margins, factor.scores, etc.) has been added for 
fitting the Graded Response Model for ordinal polytomous manifest 
variables. An extra feature of the plot method for classes 'grm', 
'ltm' and 'rasch' is the possibility to plot Item or Test Information 
Curves. You may find a more detailed description of the new features 
of the package in the CHANGES file.

Future plans include development of functions for the three-parameter 
logistic model.

Any kind of feedback (questions, suggestions, bug-reports, etc.) is 
more than welcome.

Message-ID: <200603210816.00299.ahenningsen@agric-econ.uni-kiel.de>

Dear R users,

The authors of the systemfit package have released a new version of this 
package with substantial enhancements. 
The systemfit package contains functions for fitting simultaneous systems of 
linear equations using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares 
(WLS), Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR), Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS), 
Weighted Two-Stage Least Squares (W2SLS), and Three-Stage Least Squares 
(3SLS). 
The new enhancements include the ability to test linear restrictions using an 
F, Wald or likelihood-ratio test and the ability to test model specification 
using the Hausman test. The major enhancements include better estimation 
using large data sets as well as many minor improvements, e.g. the ability to 
define how the residual covariance matrix and degrees of freedom are 
computed. The new version includes a wrapper function systemfitClassic that 
can be applied to (classical) panel-like data in long format. Furthermore, 
version 0.8-0 includes additional documentation 
(inst/doc/vignette_systemfit.pdf).

Message-ID: <971536df0603280506u7bb23e48he527d21b2ae8e144@mail.gmail.com>

gsubfn is a package with one function, gsubfn, that
is like gsub except instead of taking a replacement
string it takes a replacement function.  For each
match, that match is passed to the replacement
function along with the backreferences, if any,
and replaced with the output of the function.
If the first two arguments are omitted the defaults
are set to do perl-style (sort of) string interpolation
as in last example.

gsubfn is available for all platforms via CRAN.

# makes all letters except first in word lower case
# output: "I Like A Banana Split"
gsubfn("\\B.", tolower, "I LIKE A BANANA SPLIT")

# adds 1 to each number in third arg
# output: "(11 21)(101 31)"
gsubfn("[[:digit:]]+", function(x) as.numeric(x)+1, "(10 20)(100 30)")

# replaces pairs m:n with their sum
# first argument of f is the match; 2nd & 3rd are the 2 backreferences
# output: "abc 30 def 70 50"
f <- function(x,y,z) as.numeric(y)+as.numeric(z)
gsubfn("([0-9]+):([0-9]+)", f, "abc 10:20 def 30:40 50")

# extracts numbers from string and places them into vector v
# v becomes: 12 34 56 89 12
v <- c(); f <- function(x) v <<- append(v,as.numeric(x))
junk <- gsubfn("[0-9]+", f, "12;34:56,89,,12")
v

# string interpolation (perl-style, somewhat)
# output: pi = 3.14159265358979, 2pi = 6.28318530717959

Message-ID: <EC6501D4A6BB5442B583E3FABC9D131F0644899C@exchange.ad.acadiau.ca>

I'd like to announce the availability of a new library for hybrid
hierarchical clustering, "hybridHclust".  The library has been uploaded
to CRAN and is now available.

The library implements a hybrid of top-down and bottom-up hierarchical
clustering.  Along the way, the idea of a "mutual cluster" is developed.
A mutual cluster is a set of observations whose largest within-group
distance is smaller than the distance to the closest point outside the
set.  The hybrid method is a top-down approach that preserves such
mutual clusters.

Mutual clusters are useful in their own right, and have the interesting
property that they cannot be "broken" by many bottom-up methods.  Tools
that graphically integrate mutual clusters into bottom-up methods are
also included in the library.

Lastly, an implementation of Michael Eisen's bottom-up clustering
algorithm is also in the library.

A paper, soon to appear in Biostatistics, describes this work:

Applications to Microarray Data", available at

Message-ID: <07E228A5BE53C24CAD490193A7381BBB30E39C@LP-EXCHVS07.CO.IHC.COM>

The package blockrand is now available on CRAN.

This package aids in doing block randomizations for clinical trials or
other situations where subjects or experimental units arrive over time
and need to be randomized one at a time.  The block randomization keeps
the number of subjects in each arm of the trial fairly balanced.

The package also includes a plot function that creates a pdf file of
randomization cards that can be put in envelopes and given to a study

Message-ID: <443006A1.8070008@rumms.uni-mannheim.de>

Dear R users,

Version denpro_0.8.1 of denpro package is available.

Denpro is a package for visualization of  multivariate functions, sets, 
and data.
It is specialized for visualizing multivariate density functions
and density estimates.

A basic tool is a level set tree,
which makes a recursive approximation of a multivariate function.
With the help of level set trees one may define shape isomorphic
transformations of a multivariate function to a 1D function.
More information is available on the web-page

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0604112031080.7162-100000@reclus.nhh.no>

>From version 2.01-17, splancs, a package for spatial point pattern 
analysis, depends on package sp. 

Because both packages have defined a bounding box function bbox(), the
bbox() method in sp has been given priority, and the default object for
dispatch is an array with two or more columns (as in splancs until now).

However, the deprecated splancs function returned a non-closed rectangle
of coordinates, rather than the 2x2 matrix returned by sp bbox().

Consequently, any splancs bbox() uses in user code need to be replaced by
bboxx(bbox()), where bboxx() is a helper function unrolling the sp bbox()  
output into the form used until now by splancs.

With apologies for the bumpy ride,

Subject: [R-pkgs] Version 1.0 of hapassoc now available from CRAN
Message-ID: <20060418195026.GA6763@sfu.ca>

Version 1.0 of hapassoc now available from CRAN

hapassoc is an R package for likelihood inference of trait associations 
with SNP haplotypes and other attributes using the EM Algorithm. Recent 
changes include the addition of anova and logLik methods for the 
class hapassoc, to allow users to perform likelihood ratio tests of 
haplotype effects. Other changes include bug-fixes and improvements to 
the documentation, such as the addition of a package vignette. See the 
exerpt from the ChangeLog for more details.

ChangeLog

2006-04-04 Version 1.0

 * hapassoc(): the "baseline" argument is documented to have default
   equal to the most common haplotype, but the code to implement this
   default was lost and needed to be replaced.
 * hapassoc(): added a "verbose" flag. Default is verbose=FALSE. If
   TRUE users see the iteration number and value of the convergence
   criterion at each iteration of the EM algorithm.
 * pre.hapassoc(): added a "verbose" flag. Default is verbose=TRUE.
   If TRUE users see a list of the SNP genotypes used to form
   haplotypes and a list of the other "non-haplotype" variables.
 * Package vignette "hapassoc" added. After loading the package, type
   vignette("hapassoc") to view.

2006-03-22

 * Overall addition of the log-likelihood functions
 * hapassoc(): function now returns log-likelihood and model
 * logLik.hapassoc(): New function to extract the log-likelihood from
   a hapassoc object
 * anova.hapassoc(): New function to perform likelihood ratio test on
   two hapassoc objects.

2006-02-02 Minor changes:

 * EMvar(): fixed a bug occurring when all haplotype phases are known.
 * RecodeHaplos(): fixed a bug where a single column of non-haplotype
   data in a non-allelic data set was losing its name.
 * hapassoc(): Change "..." argument of hapassoc to "start".
   Previously the only intended use of "..." was to allow the user to
   pass in "start" for starting values to the glm function, rather
   than to allow the user to pass in other optional arguments to glm.
   We have now made this more explicit by making this argument more
   specific.

Subject: [R-pkgs] pls package: bugfix release 1.2-1
Message-ID: <m0aca7s31f.fsf@bar.nemo-project.org>

Version 1.2-1 of the pls package is now available on CRAN.

This is mainly a bugfix-release.  If you fit multi-response models,
you are strongly engouraged to upgrade!


The main changes since 1.2-0 are

- Fixed bug in kernelpls.fit() that resulted in incorrect results when fitting
  mulitresponse models with fewer responses than predictors
- Changed default radii in corrplot()
- It is now possible to select the radii of the circles in corrplot

See the file CHANGES in the sources for all changes.


The pls package implements partial least squares regression (PLSR) and
principal component regression (PCR).  Features of the package include

- Several plsr algorithms: orthogonal scores, kernel pls and simpls
- Flexible cross-validation
- A formula interface, with traditional methods like predict, coef,
  plot and summary
- Functions for extraction of scores and loadings, and calculation of
  (R)MSEP and R2
- A simple multiplicative scatter correction (msc) implementation
- Functions for plotting predictions, validation statistics,
  coefficients, scores, loadings, biplots and correlation loadings.

************ "distr":
"distr" is to provide a conceptual treatment of random variables
(r.v.'s) by means of S4--classes. A virtual mother class "Distribution"
is introduced.
All distributions of the "stats" package are implemented as subclasses of
either "AbscontDistribution" or "DiscreteDistribution".

Using these classes, we also provide (default) methods to automatically
generate the image distributions under unary mathematical operations as
well as a general convolution algorithm.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
************ "distrSim":
Classes and methods are provided for a standardized treatment of
simulations (also under contaminations) .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
************ "distrTEst":
Classes and methods are provided for a standardized treatment of
the evaluation of statistical procedures (up to now only estimators)
at data/simulations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
************ "distrEx":
This package provides some extensions to package "distr" like:
* extreme value distribution classes,
* expectations
  +in the form E(X)  for the expectation of X where X is some
    distribution or
  +in the form E(X,f) for the expectation of f(X) where X is
     some distribution and f some function in X,
* further functionals: var, sd, IQR, mad, median
* truncated moments,
* distances between distributions
  (Hellinger, Kolmogorov, total variation, "convex contamination")
* lists of distributions,
* conditional distributions in factorized form
* conditional expectations in factorized form

Message-ID: <085FC762-1603-47A5-A147-C26DBB87DD23@soc.soton.ac.uk>

Dear List

Please find uploaded to CRAN a new package, "partitions" that
enumerates integer partitions using C.  A paper describing the
package has recently been accepted by JSS (volume 16, codesnippet 1).

Integer partitions arise in many branches of combinatorics,
and the partition function P(n) is the subject of much investigation
in pure mathematics.

The package enumerates the partitions, unequal partitions, and  
restricted
partitions of an integer; the corresponding partition functions are  
also given.
The package can conjugate partitions and calculate the Durfee square
of a partition.

I would be very interested to hear any comments or suggestions that the
List may have.

Release 0.4-0 of package misc3d is now available from CRAN.  This
package provides a small collection of functions for 3D plotting,
including 'contour3d' for computing and rendering 3D contours or
isosurfaces and 'parametric3d' for rendering parameterized surfaces.

A major change in this release is that rendering in standard and grid
graphics is now supported in addition to rgl.  To support rendering in
standard and grid graphics the package includes some functions for
managing and rendering triangle mesh representations of surfaces.
Rendering uses simple lighting and shading algorithms to represent 3D
structure.  The examples in

    example(contour3d)
    example(parametric3d)
    demo(lighting)
    demo(teapot)

illustrate some of the features.

Message-ID: <20060606233146.6bfd068f.Achim.Zeileis@R-project.org>

Dear useRs,

I've just uploaded the new version 1.1-0 of the zoo package for dealing
with regular and irregular time series data to the main CRAN site.
Source and binary packages should be available from the mirrors in the
next days.

There are two changes that are nut fully backwards compatible:
  - The package now has a NAMESPACE and most S3 methods are not exported
    explicitely anymore. If some function needs to be exported for
    useRs/developeRs of other packages, please let us know.
  - By default read.zoo() does not try to produce regular series
    anymore. The previous version could result in misleading
    computations for daily financial data, affecting especially also the
    zoo-quickref vignette. (Thanks to Ajay Shah for pointing this out.)
    The old behaviour can be restored by setting `regular = TRUE'.

For general introductions to the package see:
  vignette("zoo", package = "zoo")
  vignette("zoo-quickref", package = "zoo")

Best wishes,
Z

Message-ID: <17544.18520.122208.384189@stat.math.ethz.ch>

The R package "pcalg" is released.

The main purpose of this package is to estimate the skeleton of
a DAG given data sampled from a distribution corresponding to
this DAG.

More intuitively, you can search for "strong dependencies" in
potentially high dimensional data sets. The result will be an
undirected graph where each edge represents some dependence
statement. Optionally, the line width can be varied in order to indicate the
reliability of the dependencies found.

For more details have a look at the vignette.

I'd be happy to receive comments and suggestions for improvement.

Message-ID: <E1FppRA-0006Uv-00@DMjcadima>


Version 0.9-99 of package "subselect" is now on CRAN. 

The subselect package has functions that search for k-variable subsets
of a p-variable (p>k) data set that are optimal under some
criterion. Search algorithms include a full search algorithm "leaps",
based on Furnival and Wilson's leaps and bounds algorithm, and three
random search algorithms: a genetic algorithm ("genetic"), a simulated
annealing algorithm ("anneal") and a modified local search algorithm
("improve"). Previous versions of subselect had three criteria for
optimality ("rm", "rv" and "gcd"), based on exploratory data analysis
considerations. This new version adds four new criteria ("tau2",
"zeta2", "xi2" and "ccr12"), associated with the multivariate linear
hypothesis and the well-known test statistics for that hypothesis
(Wilks' lambda, Roy's largest root, Pillai's trace and the
Hotelling-Lawley statistic). Subselect 0.9-99 also includes two
functions that prepare the arguments for the search functions
associated with the new criteria in the most frequent contexts of
application of the multivariate linear hypothesis - linear regression
(function "lmHmat") and linear discriminant analysis ("ldaHmat") - as
well as another function ("glhHmat") that prepares these arguments for
an analysis associated with a hypothesis specified by the user. The
package documentation includes numerous examples.  

Feedback is appreciated.

Best regards,
Jorge Cadima

A new version (0.96.3) of the package 'eha' is now on CRAN. Apart from 
some bug fixes, there are some news. The most noteworthy are: (i) 
'plot.Surv' has a few new options, (ii) 'weibreg' now can fit null 
models (i.e., only scale and shape) and covariates are no longer 
automatically centered (although this is still the default), (iii) there 
is a new function, 'toBinary', which transforms a data frame suitable 
for survival analysis to a data frame suitable for ,eg, logistic 
regression as a substitute for a discrete time cox regression. In the 
process, sampling of survivors in risk sets is possible.

The Toolkit for Weighting and Analysis of Nonequivalent Groups (twang
1.0) has been released to CRAN. The package collects functions useful
for computing propensity score weights for treatment effect estimation,
developing nonresponse weights, and diagnosing the quality of those
weights. The package includes a vignette containing some basic theory
and walks through two examples. It is available by typing
vignette("twang")
at the R prompt after loading the library.

Subject: [R-pkgs] ggplot: a new system for drawing graphics in R
Message-ID: <f8e6ff050607030025k77d4075bv7faf5b68d54b56b3@mail.gmail.com>

ggplot provides a new system for drawing graphics in R, based on the
Grammar of Graphics. It combines the advantages of both base and
lattice graphics: conditioning and shared axes are handled
automatically, and you can still build up a plot step by step from
multiple data sources. It also implements a more sophisticated
multidimensional conditioning system and a consistent interface to map
data to visual attributes.  ggplot (along with reshape) received the
John Chambers Award for Statistical Computing.

ggplot is available now from CRAN (install.packages("ggplot")) and
more information is available at my website (http://had.co.nz/ggplot)
including copies of talks, examples, and a guide showing how to
convert your existing lattice code.

To get started I recommend you look at:

 * the introductory vignette: vignette("introduction", "ggplot")
 * help for the quick plotting command: ?qplot
 * help for the full plotting commands: ?ggplot

I want to provide great documentation, so if there is anything you
think I am missing, please let me know.

Regards,

Hadley

Message-ID: <20060702212429.GC758@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

The Rassist package has been loaded to CRAN.  This package is designed
to make R easier for new users, by providing extra checks and
feedback. 

Presently the package functionality includes:

* offers an alternative help facility, eg(.), with examples first,
  with additional examples included.  eg() offers a start help menu,
  and eg(.) incorporates help.search(.) automatically.  It also
  locates the relevant package if not loaded.

* Some mathematical functions validate input received.  They give
  feedback on units used, and when in error, prompt the user to
  correct the input.

* plot(.) offers feedback and cautions about input format.  

* deskcheck incorporates debug(), in straight forward testing.

* source(.), under development, in error produces a directory listing.

We believe that much remains to be done, but we wanted to solicit
community feedback from interested parties. Please pass on suggestions
for other functions, or better ways to achieve the same goals, to me.

Cheers

Andrew

Subject: [R-pkgs] package simecol uploaded to CRAN
Message-ID: <44ABDE63.6090204@TU-Dresden.de>

Dear useRs,

a new and completely re-worked version of the "simecol" package

   SIMulatiion of ECOLogical (and other) dynamic systems

is now available on CRAN. Compared to the S3 based 0.2-x versions an
improved object model using S4 classes was employed. Please ask me for
assistance in case of incompatibility.

Comments are welcome, Thomas Petzoldt

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract:
=========

The simecol package is intended to give users (scientists and students)
and interactive environment to implement, distribute, simulate and
document ecological and other dynamic models without the need to write
long simulation programs. An object oriented approach based on the S4
class system is proposed, which should provide a consistent but still
flexible and extensible way to implement dynamic models.

Models of different type are provided as data and in source code (see
directory "examples") which are intended as a starting point to write
and distribute your own simObj models.

The package is supplemented with several utility functions (e.g.
seedfill or neighbours), which can be used independently from simObj
objects.

More Info:
==========

? simecol-package: general description of the package
? parms: functions to get or set model parameters etc.


Examples:
=========

file.show(system.file("examples/lv.R", package = "simecol"))
file.show(system.file("examples/conway.R", package = "simecol"))
file.show(system.file("examples/upca.R", package = "simecol"))

Subject: [R-pkgs] glmmML updated
Message-ID: <148ed8180607120959j361f7893h3aeab3551fae490@mail.gmail.com>

I have uploaded a new version (0.30-2) of glmmML to CRAN today.

This is a rather extensive upgrade, mostly internal. Adaptive
Gauss-Hermite quadrature (GHQ) is now used for the evaluation of the
integrals in the log likelihood function. The user can choose the number
of points (default is 16), I _think_ that choosing 1 point will result
in a Laplace approximation. The integrals in the score and hessian
are evaluated by the QUADPACK function 'Rdqagi' which is the C code
behind the R function 'integrate'. This specific combination of the two
methods seems to work best. (I often get _exactly_ (up to seven digits)
the same value with the two methods, but in some extreme cases one may
fail and not the other.)

New components in the output from 'glmmML' are 'posterior.means' and
posterior.modes'. The modes are found by using 'vmmin' (behind R's
'optim') on the integrands in the GHQ, the means by numerical
integration. Usually, they do not differ much.

A special problem is situations where the random effects variance is
very small or zero. I may happen that glmmML is unable to get the
likelihood value above the value given by 'glm' on the corresponding
model with no clustering. In such a case zero variance is reported, with
a standard error that is NA. A warning is also given. If a test of the
hypothesis that sigma = 0 is on the wish list, a p-value can be
estimated by bootstrapping, see the input parameter 'boot'. The only
option now is a parametric bootstrap; I have removed the 'conditional'
approach.

As usual, comments, and error and bug reports are welcome.

and your local mirror.

The package extends Sweave to Open Document Format (ODF) text document 
files. Latex-style code chunks and in-line Sexpr commands can be used 
to embed R output into ODF file, which can then be exported to doc, 
rtf, html, pdf and other formats.

Other functions in the package facilitate ODF formatted tables, text 
and lists.

The current limitations of the package are:

 O tangling is not yet implement (but will be)

 O testing has been done on text documents generated by OpenOffice. 
   Other formats/editors may work, but are not (yet) supported.

Message-ID: <b0808fdc0607210119q34a4933re2f10d45309d7478@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,
I've just uploaded  2 packages on CRAN, RTisean and tsDyn, both for time
series analysis (joint research projects with members of the Statistics
Department, University of Udine). Brief descriptions follow.

RTisean is an R interface to TISEAN executables
(http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~tisean/). TISEAN is a suite of C
and Fortran routines for nonlinear time series analysis, coded and
documented by Rainer Hegger, Holger Kantz and Thomas Schreiber. In
RTisean, almost all TISEAN routines are wrapped in a conventional R
function (which silently calls TISEAN executables), with online help
and examples (thanks to Gianluca Gazzola).

tsDyn is a package for nonlinear time series modelling. At this point
the package focuses on Nonlinear Autoregressive Models, often indicated as
NLAR (as a major reference, see Tong (1990)). Currently available are
threshold (SETAR and LSTAR), neural networks (NNET), and additive
autoregressive (AAR) models. An experimental cross-platform tcltk GUI is
included for model selection. Explorative and diagnostic tools are
also available. A vignette is included for a clearer presentation of the
package contents.

Comments and suggestions appreciated

Subject: [R-pkgs] seqinr updated :  release 1.0-5
Message-ID: <44C60DA8.6070602@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr>

Dear R users,


seqinR 1.0-5 has been released yesterday on CRAN, so that the source code
of the package should be available on all CRAN mirrors within the next 24h.

The updated package vignette is here:
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/seqinr_1_0-5.pdf

User level visible changes are:

o  A  new function dotPlot() is now available.
   
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/dotPlot.html

o  A new function crelistfromclientdata() is now available to create a 
list on
   the server from a local file of sequence names, sequence accession 
numbers,
   species names, or keywords names.

http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/crelistfromclientdata.html 


o  A new function pmw() to compute the molecular weight of a protein is now
   available.
   http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/pmw.html

o  A new function reverse.align() contributed by Anamaria Necsulea is now
   available to align CDS at the protein level and then reverse translate
   this at the nucleic acid level from a clustalw output. This can be done
   on the fly if clustalw is available on your platform.

http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/reverse.align.html 


o  An undocumented behavior was reported by Guy Perriere for uco() when
   computing RSCU on sequences where an amino-acid is missing. There is
   now a new argument NA.rscu that allows the user to force the missing
   values to his favorite magic value.
   http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/uco.html

o  There was a bug in read.fasta(): some sequence names were truncated, 
this
   is now fixed (thanks to Marcus G. Daniels for pointing this).
   In order to be more consistent with standard functions such as 
read.table()
   or scan(), the file argument starts now with a lower case letter 
(i.e."file")
   in function read.fasta(), but the old-style "File" is still 
functional for
   forward-compatibility. There is a new logical argument in read.fasta()
   named as.string to allow sequences to be returned as strings instead of
   vector of single characters. The automatic conversion of DNA 
sequences into
   lower case letters can now be disabled with the new logical argument
   forceDNAtolower. It is also possible to disable the automatic attributes
   settings with the new logical argument set.attributes.

http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/read.fasta.html 


o  A new function write.fasta() is now available.

http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/write.fasta.html 


o  The function kaks() now forces character in sequences to upper case.
   This default behavior can be neutralized in order to save time by 
setting the
   argument forceUpperCase to FALSE.
   http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR/SEQINR_CRAN/DOC/html/kaks.html

all the best,

Simon

A new version of odfWeave is on CRAN. Changes include:

 - handling of locales. Errors were being produced when locales were set
to anything but "C". The fix changes the locale to "C" and changes back
to the original locale when the user's code is executed.

 - a bug fix for default plot device units (to prevent bitmap graphics
from being 480x480 inches on non-Windows systems).

 - a check was inserted at the beginning of the odfWeave function to
test for zipping/unzipping utilities. This is only done if the default
value for zipCmd in odfWeaveControl was not used. A more meaningful
error message is produced.

 - the manual is now a "legal" package vignette and accessible using
vignette("odfWeave").

Message-ID: <f8e6ff050608060753w28e532cby139b9abdf579844@mail.gmail.com>

Reshape 0.7
===================

Reshape is an R package for flexibly restructuring and aggregating
data. It is inspired by Excel's pivot tables, and it  makes it very
easy to view your data the way you want. The reshape package (along
with ggplot) received the John Chambers Award for Statistical
Computing. You can find out more at http://had.co.nz/reshape.

Reshape (hopefully) makes it easy to do what you have been struggling
to do with tapply, by, aggregate, xtabs, apply and summarise.  It is
also useful for getting your data into the correct structure for
lattice or ggplot plots.

This new version of reshape substantially expands the type of output
you can cast into.  You can now make nested lists, cast(m, a ~ b | c)
or cast(m, a ~ b | c + d), and multidimensional arrays, cast(m, a ~ b
~ c) (or any combination of the two).  See the examples in ?cast.

What else is new?:

 * iapply, an idempotent apply function that returns results with the
same dimensionality as the input (very useful in conjunction with
sweep and multidimensional arrays)

 * rescaler, a function to rescale data.frames variable by variable
using a range of different scaling methods

 * combine_factor and reorder_factor to make it easier to combine and
reorder factor levels

 * bug fixes!

All feedback is welcomed, and if you are struggling with reshaping
your data and the reshape package isn't helping, please let me know.

Hadley

Subject: [R-pkgs] Random Survival Forest 1.0.0 is now available.
Message-ID: <DOEKJCLKLCEDEDHLDCJICEFOCNAA.ubk@kogalur-shear.com>

Dear useRs,

Release 1.0.0 of the new R package 'randomSurvivalForest' is now available
on CRAN and its mirrors.  The package implements Ishwaran and Kogalur's
Random Survival Forests algorithm for right censored survival data.  The
algorithm is closely patterned after Breiman's random forests, but suitably
modified for the survival setting.  Some key features are:

o An ensemble cumulative hazard is constructed
    from binary recursive survival trees grown
    under different splitting rules.

o Mortality estimates interpretable in terms
    of total number of deaths are provided.

o An out-of-bag estimate of Harrell's concordance
    index is provided for assessing prediction.

Detailed information on usage can be found in the manual.

Thank you.

Hemant Ishwaran,  Udaya B. Kogalur

Message-ID: <148ed8180608210212k6a7858d9s3e01011588fec2ec@mail.gmail.com>

A new version, 0.65-1, of glmmML is now on CRAN. It is a major rewrite
of the inner structures, so frequent updates (bug fixes) may be
expected for some time.

News:

* The Laplace and adaptive Gauss-Hermite approximations to the log
likelihood function are fully implemented. The Laplace method is made
the default. It should give results you can compare to the results
from 'lmer' (for the models that glmmML can handle).

* Binomial responses can now be represented as a two-column matrix
with No. of successes and No. of failures, respectively, as in glm.

* New functions: 'ghq' for calculating the constants used in the
Gauss-Hermite quadrature. 'extractAIC.glmmML', which makes it possible
to use functions like 'dropterm' (MASS) on glmmML fits.

* There are three choices of distribution for the random effects:
'gaussian' (default), 'logistic', and 'cauchy'.

* The 'conditional' bootstrap is removed, so the only choice now is
the parametric bootstrap.

* The 'posterior.means' are no longer calculated, leaving only the
'posterior.modes' as 'predictions' of the random effects.

As usual, feedback is more than welcome!

Subject: [R-pkgs] ANN: 'weaver' package, caching for Sweave
Message-ID: <m2u045zf1a.fsf@ziti.fhcrc.org>

Hi all,

I've added a new package 'weaver' to the BioC repository:

http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/1.9/bioc/html/weaver.html

The weaver package provides extensions to the Sweave utilities
included in R's base package.  The focus of the extensions is on
caching computationally expensive (time consuming) code chunks in
Sweave documents.

Why would you want to cache code chunks?  If your Sweave document
includes one or more code chunks that take a long time to compute, you
may find it frustrating to make small changes to the document.  Each
run requires recomputing the "expensive" code chunks.  If these chunks
aren't changing, you can benefit from the caching provided by weaver.

To install:

  source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
  biocLite("weaver")

If you give it a try and have any feedback, drop me a note.

Hi again,

Sorry for the noise, but I need to make a correction:

At present, the above install sequence will _only_ work if you are
using a development version of R.

If you are using the current R release, you will have to work a bit
harder to install (put weaver works there too):

First install weaver's dependencies:

  digest (on CRAN)

  codetools:
    http://bioconductor.org/packages/1.9/omegahat/html/codetools.html

Then install weaver:
    http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/1.9/bioc/html/weaver.html

Finally, I will try to make Windows binaries available by the end of
the week.

Message-ID: <17644.63427.629643.303941@maths.uwa.edu.au>


A new version 1.9-5 of the package `spatstat' 
has been uploaded to CRAN.

What it is:
----------
spatstat is a package for analysing spatial data, mainly Spatial Point
Patterns. 

What's in it:
------------
Functions for exploratory data analysis, model-fitting, simulation,
spatial sampling, model diagnostics, and formal inference. Data types
include point patterns, line segment patterns, spatial windows, and
pixel images. Point patterns may include marks (e.g. multitype
points).  Spatial windows can have irregular shape (polygons with
holes, binary images).  Point process models can be fitted to point
pattern data. Cluster models are fitted by the method of minimum
contrast. Very general Gibbs point process models can be fitted to
point pattern data using a function ppm similar to lm or glm. Models
may include dependence on covariates, interpoint interaction and
dependence on marks. Fitted models can be simulated
automatically. Also provides facilities for formal inference (such as
chi-squared tests) and model diagnostics (including simulation
envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots).

Spatstat is one of the largest packages available on CRAN,
with over 270 functions.

Message-ID: <20060825031952.1792caf0.Achim.Zeileis@R-project.org>

Dear useRs,

the new version 1.2-0 of the zoo package for dealing with regular and
irregular time series data is available from the CRAN mirrors.

This version includes two important changes/enhancements:

  - rapply() was re-named to rollapply() because from R 2.4.0 on,
    base R provides a function rapply() for recursive (not rolling)
    application of functions, which was already described in the Green
    Book. zoo::rapply() currently still exists for backward
    compatibility, however, it is flagged as deprecated and now
    dispatches to rollapply() methods. We recommend to change existing
    scripts from using rapply() to rollapply().

  - xyplot() methods for "zoo", "ts", and "its" objects have been
    added for creating trellis time series graphs. The functions
    are still under development and suggestions for improvement are
    welcome.

For general introductions to the package see:
  vignette("zoo", package = "zoo")
  vignette("zoo-quickref", package = "zoo")

Best wishes,
Z

Dear useRs,

a new version 2.0-0 of the sandwich package for estimating sandwich
covariance matrices is available from the CRAN mirrors.

The tools for computing heteroskedasticity (and autocorrelation)
consistent covariance matrix estimators (also called HC
and HAC estimators, including the Eicker-Huber-White estimator)
have been generalized over the last releases from linear regression to
general parametric models. These new object-oriented features of the
sandwich package are also described in paper published in the Journal
of Statistical Software (JSS) that accompanies this release. See
  http://www.jstatsoft.org/

The new JSS paper and the previous one (accompanying version 1.0-0) are
also available as package vignettes:

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package 'random' for non-deterministic random number
Message-ID: <17654.21522.980572.948491@basebud.nulle.part>


Dear useRs,

A few days ago, the initial version 0.1.0 of a new package 'random' was
uploaded to CRAN.

The random packages provides convenient access to the non-deterministic
random numbers provided by the random.org site created by Mads Haahr
(http://www.random.org).  

While certain hardware and software solutions that provide access to
non-deterministic random-numbers exist, few if any are portable across all
the hardware platforms R supports. Retrieving non-deterministic random
numbers may be beneficial to seed parallel simulations with independent
draws, to obtain portable initializations for other RNGs, to validate
simulation with non-deterministic RNGs, or simply for fun and
experimentations.

The package contains five simple functions 
     randomNumber	(random integeres between min, max w/ duplicates)
     randomSequence	(random sequences between min, max w/o duplicates)
     randomBytes	(in hex, dec, oct or bin)
     randomBufferStatus (to query the server status)
     sufficientBits	(boolean test of randomBufferStats vs rec'ed value)

Also included are two vignettes that can be accessed via
     vignette("random-intro", package = "random")
     vignette("random-essay", package = "random")

'random-intro' provides some background on the package as well as initial
test results using the dieharder suite by Robert G. Brown. I hope to expand
on these tests in the near future. 'random-essay' is a transcript of the web
essay at http://www.random.org/essay.html and provides some background on the
random.org service.

Some information is / will be at 
     http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/random.html will 

Comments or suggestions are more than welcome!

Regards, Dirk

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package ffmanova for 50-50 MANOVA released
Message-ID: <m0wt8pjajl.fsf@bar.nemo-project.org>

Version 0.1-0 of a new package `ffmanova' is now available on CRAN.

Comments, suggestions, etc. are welcome.  Please use the email address
ffmanova (at) mevik.net.

The package implements 50-50 MANOVA (Langsrud, 2002) with p-value
adjustment based on rotation testing (Langsrud, 2005).

The 50-50 MANOVA method is a modified variant of classical MANOVA made
to handle several highly correlated responses.  Classical MANOVA
performs poorly in such cases and it collapses when the number of
responses exceeds the number of observations.  The 50-50 MANOVA method
is suggested as a general method that will handle all types of data.
Principal component analysis is an integrated part of the algorithm.

The single response special case is ordinary general linear modeling.
Type II sums of squares are used to handle unbalanced designs
(Langsrud, 2003).  Furthermore, the Type II philosophy is extended to
continuous design variables.  This means that the method is invariant
to scale changes.  Centering of design variables is not needed.  The
Type II approach ensures that common pitfalls are avoided.

A univariate F-test p-value for each response can be reported when
several responses are present.  However, with a large number of
response variables, these results are questionable since we will
expect a lot of type I errors ("incorrect significance").  Therefore
the p-values need to be adjusted.

By using rotation testing it is possible to adjust the single response
p-values according to the familywise error rate criterion in an exact
and non-conservative (unlike Bonferroni) way.

It is also possible to adjust p-values according to a false discovery
rate criterion.  Our method is based on rotation testing and allows
any kind of dependence among the responses (Moen et al., 2005).

Note that rotation testing is closely related to permutation testing.
One difference is that rotation testing relies on the multinormal
assumption.  All the classical tests (t-test, F-test, Hotelling T^2
test, ...) can be viewed as special cases of rotation testing.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New forecasting bundle of packages
Message-ID: <44F9FB03.5050703@buseco.monash.edu.au>

v1.0 of the forecasting bundle of packages is now on CRAN and will 
propagate to mirrors shortly.

The forecasting bundle of R packages provides new forecasting methods, 
and graphical tools for displaying and analysing forecasts. It comprises 
the following packages:

     * forecast: Functions and methods for forecasting.

     * fma: All data sets from Makridakis, Wheelwright and Hyndman 
(1998)         Forecasting: methods and applications, Wiley & Sons: New 
York.

     * Mcomp: All data from the M1 and M3 forecast competitions.

Key features:

* a "forecast" method and class which can be applied to Arima, StructTS, 
HoltWinters and other time series models. This is preferred to predict() 
as it provides output in a consistent format (the "forecast" class) that 
can be used by other functions.

* automatic univariate time series forecasting based on exponential 
smoothing state space models. This is much more general and flexible 
than HoltWinters().

* automatic ARIMA forecasting based on minimizing the AIC or BIC.

* several new forecasting methods and time series graphics.

Some features of the forecast package were the subject of my talk at 
UseR! in Vienna in June. Slides of the talk are at 
http://www.robhyndman.info/talks/Hyndman_UseR.pdf

Anyone who has been using earlier versions of the packages from my web 
pages should check out the list of changes at 
http://www.robhyndman.info/Rlibrary/forecast/

Dear R-users,

I'd like to announce the release of the new version of package 'ltm' 
for analyzing multivariate dichotomous and polytomous data under the 
Item Response Theory approach.

New features:

* function tpm() (along with supporting methods, i.e., anova, plot, 
margins, factor.scores, etc.) has been added for fitting Birnbaum's 
Three Parameter Model.

* grm() can now handle mix of dichotomous and polytomous items.

* descript() returns more output, especially for dichotomous manifest 
variables.

For more details check the CHANGES file. Future plans include 
development of functions for goodness-of-fit, and the Partial Credit 
Model.

Any kind of feedback (questions, suggestions, bug-reports, etc.) is 
more than welcome.


Best,

Version 0.4.4 of odfWeave is available from CRAN. A Windows binary
should be available shortly.

This version requires base R version 2.3.1 or greater.

Changes from the last version include

  - Non-English character sets are handled better. For example, Chinese
characters can be included in R code. See the file "testCases.odt" in
the examples directory for an example

  - Image specifications, such as format and size, have been moved out
of odfWeaveControl. They are now controlled by the functions
getImageDefs and setImageDefs. This change allows the user to easily
modify the image properties in code chunks so that figures can have
different sizes or types throughout the document.

  - When odfWeave is invoked, a check for a zip program is done and a
more meaningful error is reported. This should help users better
understand the odfWeave software dependencies. 

  - A new XML parser was written so that users no longer need to turn
off the "size optimization" feature in OpenOffice. 

  - Three bugs were fixed:

    o If the user specified a relative path to the source file, an error
occurred

    o Fonts contained in the style definitions are automatically
registered in the ODF document. Previously, fonts that specified using
setStyleDefs but were not used in the document were ignored. Now, the
fonts found using getStyleDefs() at the start of odfWeave execution are
added to the document.

    o A new function, odfTmpDir, is now used to set the path to the
working directory. A new directory is created in the location of
tempdir().

As always, please send any comments, suggestions or bug reports to
max.kuhn at pfizer.com.

Subject: [R-pkgs] cairoDevice 1.2 on CRAN
Message-ID: <451287F7.90200@iastate.edu>

The cairoDevice package has recently been released on CRAN. cairoDevice 
is an R graphics device based on the cairo 
(http://www.cairographics.org) vector graphics library. It is 
distinguished from many other devices in its ability to render high 
quality anti-aliased graphics. It is available on all three major 
platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux) and requires the GTK+ 2.8.0 library 
and its dependencies. For the current users, version 1.2 fixes many bugs.

cairoDevice is capable of rendering in three different ways: to the 
screen inside a GTK+ window, to an arbitrary GtkDrawingArea that is part 
of an RGtk2 GUI, or to any GdkDrawable, allowing for example the output 
of png and jpg images derived from R graphics using the GdkPixbuf 
bindings from RGtk2.

cairoDevice is interactive in that it supports the locator tool as well 
as the getGraphicsEvent() functionality, which previously was available 
only from the Windows device.

To obtain the requisite GTK+ (>= 2.8.0) libraries:

Windows: Download and run the installer from http://gladewin32.sf.net.
Mac: DarwinPorts
Linux: packages from your distribution

Please enjoy the package and let me know if you have any problems,

Michael Lawrence

Message-ID: <f8e6ff050609301449j7f4cca00kcb99315ff275955a@mail.gmail.com>

Reshape version 0.7.1
=====================

Reshape is an R package for flexibly restructuring and aggregating
data.  It's inspired by Excel's pivot tables, and it (hopefully) makes
it very easy to get your data into the shape that you want.  You can find out
more at http://had.co.nz/reshape

What's new in this version?

 * A 25 page introductory vignette, also available at
http://had.co.nz/reshape/introduction.pdf, which shows some of the
many ways that you can use reshape.

 * The biggest change is that reshape now outputs regular data.frames,
which should make it easier to use them for further analysis and
transformation.

 * Added a fill argument to cast which specifies what value should be
used for structural missings

Various bug fixes and completion missing features:

 * fun.aggregate will always be applied if specified, even if no
aggregation occurs

 * margins now work for non-aggregated data

 * cast now accepts a list of functions for fun.aggregate

 * very long formulas will now work in cast

 * fixed bug in rbind.fill

 * should be able to melt any cast form

Please let me know if you have any comments, questions, or something
isn't working right.

Hadley

ade4TkGUI is a new package available on CRAN. It implements a Tcl/Tk
graphical user interface (GUI) for the ade4 package.

Only the most basic functions of ade4 have a GUI in this first
version : classical one-table data analysis methods (PCA, COA,
MCA, PCO, etc.), one table with groups of rows (BGA, WGA, DA),
and two-tables analysis methods (Coinertia analysis, CCA, PCAIV).
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/JTHome/ade4TkGUI.jpg

One of the benefits of using ade4TkGUI is the centralized graphical
display of the dudi objects created by ade4. A dudi is a list with
many components http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/ade4html/dudi.html
The GUI presents a window in which the user can click on dudi
components to get predefined graphical displays : 
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/JTHome/coa1dudi.jpg

Another benefit is for complex functions, and particularly graphical
functions that have many parameters. For example, the s.class function
has 27 parameters : http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/ade4html/s.class.html
In this case, the GUI makes it much easier to try various graphical
options : http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/JTHome/s.class.jpg

ade4TkGUI also contains a factor map exploration function, written by
Stephane Dray. This function allows dynamic operations like zooming,
panning, and identification of points by searching on labels on the
factor maps : http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/JTHome/explore.jpg

Current version (ade4TkGUI_0.1-4) depends on ade4_1.4-2, and the
dynamic factor map exploration function depends on tkrplot. Future
versions will add GUIs for more advanced ade4 methods, like ktables
analysis methods, or spatial methods, and for more graphical functions.

All comments are welcome. Please use the adelist mailing list :

Subject: [R-pkgs] New versions of Matrix and lme4 packages for R-2.4.0
Message-ID: <40e66e0b0610030756j7f966eb9k8ab90c9daf047580@mail.gmail.com>

Versions 0.9975-1 of the Matrix and lme4 packages will soon be available on
CRAN for use with R version 2.4.0 or later.

Purpose of the packages:

The Matrix package provides S4 classes and methods for sparse
and dense matrices.  The lme4 package provides functions for fitting
and assessing linear or generalized linear mixed effects models (also
called multilevel models).  Like the Matrix package, the lme4 package
uses S4 classes and methods.

Features of this release:

- These package versions are designed for use with release 2.4.0 or
 later of R.  Because of enhancements in S4 classes and methods in
 R-2.4.0 the packages load much faster than before and the functions
 can be organized differently.  In particular, the lmer function for
 fitting linear or generalized linear models is again in the lme4
 package. The C code of lme4 now calls C code that is exported from Matrix

Matrix package improvements:

- The  Matrix() constructor function has become more versatile and you
  are advised to read the help page and try its examples.

- Reorganization and simplification of source code (source package is
  about 1/3 the previous size).  Much greater use of virtual classes
  in method definitions.

- LU and QR decompositions for sparse matrices using the CSparse
  library of C functions written by Tim Davis and documented in his
  2006 SIAM book "Direct Methods for Sparse Linear Systems".  New
  function Cholesky (in addition to function chol) that allows the
  full range of CHOLMOD library options for sparse Cholesky
  decompositions.

- New classes to distinguish between sparse logical matrices and
  sparse pattern matrices.

- NAs are now properly dealt with in sparse and dense matrices.

- Printing of sparse matrices now distinguishes structural zeros and
  values that can be nonzero but happen to be equal to zero.

- New functions triu, tril and band patterned after those in Octave
  and Matlab.

lme4 package improvements:

- Allow specification of nested random effects using terms of the form
 (1|block/field)

- Model specifications without fixed effects, such as travel ~ (1|Rail),
  are allowed.  Previously the implicit intercept term needed to be
  explicitly specified as travel ~ 1 + (1 | Rail).

- Error declared when the number of levels of a grouping factor is not
   less than the number of observations.

- Default estimation method for GLMMs is now optimization of the
  Laplace approximation to the log-likelihood

- Reorganization and simplification of source code.  Allow for models,
  such as multilevel item response theory models or models with
  carry-over of teacher effects, that extend the linear or generalized
  linear mixed model.

- Fixed bug, reported by Goran Brostrom, in calculation of standard
  errors of coefficients in a binomial GLMM where the response is
  given as a matrix.

Dear R users,

The package proptest (http://www.davidkraus.net/proptest/) has been
recently released to CRAN.

The package provides functions for testing the proportional hazards
assumption in the Cox model for right censored survival data. Two types of
tests for identifying nonproportional covariates are implemented:

* data-driven Neyman type smooth tests (using both nested and all-subsets
variant of the BIC),

* tests based on the score process (KS, CM, and AD type, with the LWY
simulation).

Bug reports, comments or suggestions are welcome.

Regards,

David.

Dear useRs,

`multcomp' version 0.991-1 will be shortly available from 
CRAN near you. Nearly all functionality contained in the
package has been re-implemented from scratch.

The focus of the package has been extended to general linear
hypotheses in arbitrary parametric models and the most important
function to check out is `glht()'. Multiple comparison of
means procedures (for example Tukey all-pair comparisons)
are contained in the framework as special cases.

The old user interface (functions `simint()' and `simtest()') are still
available, however deprecated, and the presentation of their output 
differs from older versions of `multcomp'.

As always, feedback, feature requests and bug reports are more than 
welcome.

Best wishes,

Torsten

Since then we've made progress by improving 'portfolio' and adding two
new packages, but are still looking for collaborators who would like
to help design, build, and test this set of tools.  We hope to make
the same amount of progress in 2007 as we have in 2006.

Subject: [R-pkgs] X2R: R-compatible output routines from C, ADMB,
	Fortran to R
Message-ID: <453E24BA.2000300@noaa.gov>

We announce the availability of three related software libraries: C2R, 
ADMB2R, and For2R (together, X2R). Each contains output routines to 
simplify transfer of complicated data structures from models written in 
a compiled language to R.  The user's data can be written as a 
structured ASCII file which, when read by R (note 1) with a single 
dget() function call, will become an R data object of type list. The 
list, of course, may contain components such as data frames, matrices, 
and other lists.

These are NOT R packages; rather they are subroutine libraries to be 
used with programmers' own modeling codes.  Limited testing indicates 
that they are compatible with S-PLUS, as well (note 1, note 2).

Languages supported are Fortran 95 (with For2R), C and C++ (with C2R) 
and AD Model Builder (with ADMB2R) (note 1, note 3).  Source code and 
users' manuals are supplied. 

For those working in fish stock assessment, we anticipate releasing soon 
a related group of R functions, FishGraph.  The FishGraph functions 
create graphs useful in analysis of fisheries stock assessments whose 
output has been saved with X2R.  We have been using FishGraph for 
several years and are now completing the documentation.

This work has been tested and used by the authors. However, any software 
may contain bugs, and these works are classified by NOAA as  
"Experimental Products."  Although the software is supplied with no 
warranty whatsoever, bug reports, suggestions, and extensions are 
solicited (send to Prager or Martin).  The authors will attempt to fix 
all bugs promptly and to add requested features.

Software is now available at CRAN,  http://cran.r-project.org/ , and is 
expected to propagate to mirrors shortly.  Look under "Software / Other" 
for the current X2R distribution.

Dear all,

I have just uploaded to CRAN the version 1.5 of the
package 'adehabitat'. Significant changes are
listed below:

* the package now contains a new function allowing a factorial 
decomposition of the Mahalanobis distances in habitat selection studies, 
named madifa().

* The ENFA can now be performed using all kinds of variables (numeric, 
factors, fuzzy, mixing of several types, etc.)

* Several methods allowing the analysis of animals movements have been 
added, including the first passage time (function fpt()), a 
rediscretization algorithm (redisltraj()), and an interactive graphic 
window for dynamic analysis (trajdyn())

* A function for interactive exploration of maps of class "kasc" has 
been added (explore.kasc)

* Scott Fortmann-Roe (Univ. Berkeley) programmed a better algorithm for 
Nearest neighbour Convex hull home range estimation.

* The function kasc2spixdf() have been updated


Happy testing,

Message-ID: <eb555e660610302010y5d39e4el4db81591ea13ae0@mail.gmail.com>

CRAN now has a package called rcompletion that attempts to provide TAB
completion for R using the GNU readline library, intended for R
sessions run from a command line. From the package help page:

Description:

    This package provides pseudo-intelligent TAB completion for a
    readline enabled instance of R when it is run from a terminal (or
    more specifically, an interface which uses readline to accept user
    input). It has no effect on the various GUI interfaces to R,
    including ESS and the standard Windows interface.

The package does not compile on a standard Windows box, and there is
no Windows binary available for it. For more usage details, install
and load the package, then type

package?rcompletion

at the R prompt. The manual is also available online at

http://cran.r-project.org/doc/packages/rcompletion.pdf


Notes:

To install and use the package successfully, you need:

(1) R compiled with readline, and run with readline enabled

(2) the rcompletion package compiled with readline

The rcompletion package comes with a configure script that tries to
detect readline on the system and aborts if it is unsuccessful in
doing so. There have been no reports so far of false positives (i.e.
detecting readline when it shouldn't). However, there are known cases
of false negatives, i.e. installation failing when it shouldn't. If
this happens to you, any information you can provide to help resolve
the problem would be appreciated.

If step (2) appears to be successful but (1) is not true (e.g. R is
run with --no-readline), nothing bad (but nothing good either) should
happen.

Just a quick follow-up. Thanks to Simon Urbanek and hints from
Alexandre Aguiar, CRAN now has a version (0.0-10) of rcompletion that
should work on more systems. If it still doesn't work when you think
it should, please let me know.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package `np' - nonparametric kernel smoothing methods
	for	mixed datatypes
Message-ID: <1164396364.4185.42.camel@pc-racine1.economics.mcmaster.ca>

Dear R users,

A new package titled `np' is now available from CRAN.

The package implements recently developed kernel methods that seamlessly
handle the mix of continuous, unordered, and ordered factor datatypes
often found in applied settings. 

The package also allows users to create their own
nonparametric/semiparametric routines using high-level function calls
(via the function npksum()) rather than writing their own C or Fortran
code. Much of the code underlying the package is written in C including
the function npksum().

Currently, a range of methods can be found in the package including

- multivariate nonparametric unconditional and conditional density
estimation

- multivariate nonparametric conditional mean and gradient estimation
(local constant and local linear)

- multivariate nonparametric conditional distribution, quantile and
gradient estimation 

- nonparametric model specification tests for testing correctness of
parametric regression models

- nonparametric significance tests for nonparametric regression

- semiparametric multivariate regression methods (partially linear,
index models, average derivative estimation, varying/smooth coefficient
models)

A function npplot() is implemented that allows users to visualize the
resulting objects.

A variety of methods for computing standard errors and error bounds are
implemented including asymptotic and resampling-based methods (the
latter employing the `boot' package which is required).

A range of examples can be found in the examples section of the
accompanying help files.

We caution potential users that multivariate data-driven bandwidth
selection methods can be numerically intensive. For this reason we are
now using some of the functionality contained in the Rmpi package to
develop an MPI-aware version of the np package that we have tentatively
titled the `npRmpi' package.

The np package implements a number of methods found in the newly
released publication by Li and Racine (2007) titled Nonparametric
Econometrics: Theory and Practice, Princeton University Press.

See press.princeton.edu/titles/8355.html for further details.

Best regards, Jeff.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0611271212540.6416@elendil.ci.tuwien.ac.at>


A new version of kernlab has just been released.
kernlab is a kernel-based Machine Learning package for R.

kernlab includes the following functions:

 o ksvm() : Support Vector Machines for classification, regression,
            novelty detection, native multi-class classification, support
            for class-probability output and confidence intervals in
            regression.

 o gausspr() : Gaussian Processes for classification and regression

 o lssvm() : Least Squares Support Vector Machines for classification

 o rvm() : Relevance Vector Machines for regression

 o specc() : Spectral Clustering

 o kkmeans() : Kernel k-means clustering

 o ranking() : Kernel-based ranking method

 o onlearn() : Kernel-based Online Learning algorithms for classification,
               novelty detection and regression

 o kpca() : Kernel Pricipal Components Analysis

 o kcca() : Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis

 o kfa() : Kernel Feature Analysis

 o sigest() : Hyperparameter estimation for the Gaussian and the Laplacian kernels

 o inchol() : Incomplete Cholesky decomposition method

 o csi() : Cholesky decomposition with side information

 o ipop() : Interior point-based Quadratic Optimizer

Kernlab also includes a range of functions enabling the easy implementation of
new kernel methods including functions for computing commonly used kernel
expressions (e.g. kernel matrix, kernel expansion, etc.) and
implementations of nine kernels (e.g. Linear, Gaussian, Polynomial,
Sigmoid, Laplace, String kernels, etc.) which can be used with any of the
functions included in the package.
Ready computed kernel matrices and user defined kernel functions can also
be used.

kernlab is based on the S4 object model.
A vignette describing a large portion of the functions and features is
included.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New versions for the distr-family of packages,
 of startupmsg, and a new package "distrDoc"
Message-ID: <456C4261.7050605@uni-bayreuth.de>

We would like to announce the availability on CRAN of new versions
of our packages "distr" (1.8), "distrEx" (0.4-4), "distrSim" (1.8), "distrTEst" (1.8),
"startupmsg" (0.4) as well as a new package "distrDoc" (1.8)
[all of them require R >= 2.2.0]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
********************************* Changes ***********************************************
of "distr" (1.8), "distrEx" (0.4-4), "distrSim" (1.8), "distrTEst" (1.8), "startupmsg" (0.4)
*****************************************************************************************
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are major changes in "distrSim" and "distrTest" from this release on;
the more important ones can be inspected at

        http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/departments/math/org/mathe7/DISTR

and the pages linked to on this page.

After package installation you may also have a look
at NEWS("<pkg-name>") for all the packages mentioned in this mail.

>From this version on, we provide a more detailed manual for the distrXXX family
in form of vignette distributed separately in package "distrDoc" (see below).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Descriptions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
************ "distr":
"distr" is to provide a conceptual treatment of random variables
(r.v.'s) by means of S4--classes. A virtual mother class "Distribution"
is introduced.
All distributions of the "stats" package are implemented as subclasses of
either "AbscontDistribution" or "DiscreteDistribution".

Using these classes, we also provide (default) methods to automatically
generate the image distributions under unary mathematical operations as
well as a general convolution algorithm.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
************ "distrSim":
Classes and methods are provided for a standardized treatment of
simulations (also under contaminations) .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
************ "distrTEst":
Classes and methods are provided for a standardized treatment of
the evaluation of statistical procedures (up to now only estimators)
at data/simulations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
************ "distrEx":
This package provides some extensions to package "distr" like:
* extreme value distribution classes,
* expectations
  +in the form E(X)  for the expectation of X where X is some
    distribution or
  +in the form E(X,f) for the expectation of f(X) where X is
     some distribution and f some function in X,
* further functionals: var, sd, IQR, mad, median
* truncated moments,
* distances between distributions
  (Hellinger, Kolmogorov, total variation, "convex contamination")
* lists of distributions,
* conditional distributions in factorized form
* conditional expectations in factorized form
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
************ "distrDoc":
"distrDoc" provides a common vignette to the distrXXX family
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
************ "startupmsg":
provides utilities for start-up messages for packages
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We look forward to receiving questions, comments and suggestions

Dear useRs,

Please find the new package ibdreg version 0.1.0 on CRAN.

The package contains a method for analysis of genetic linkage 
with covariates by regression methods that use identity by descent 
(IBD) sharing probabilities for relative pairs.  The methods 
account for correlations of IBD statistics for 
relative pairs within the same pedigree.

The reference is:

Schaid DJ, Sinnwell JP, Thibodeau SN.  Testing Genetic
Linkage with Relative Pairs and Covariates by
Quasi-Likelihood Score Statistics. Submitted.

Cheers, 
Jason Sinnwell

Message-ID: <4576E007.80308@yahoo.com>

Dear useRs,

Please find the new package mFilter version 0.1-2 on CRAN.

The package implements several time series filters useful for smoothing
and extracting trend and cyclical components of a time series. The
routines are commonly used in economics and finance, however they should
also be interest to other areas. Currently, Christiano-Fitzgerald,
Baxter-King, Hodrick-Prescott, Butterworth, and trigonometric regression
filters are included in the package.

Subject: [R-pkgs] rggobi 2.1.4-3
Message-ID: <f8e6ff050612060947n43afd3ffifb33e064a89fc21d@mail.gmail.com>

We are pleased to announce version 2.1.4-3 of rggobi. This release
introduces many new features, including the ability to open new
displays, and get and set tour projections.

The rggobi package provides a command-line interface to GGobi, an
interactive and dynamic graphics package. Rggobi complements GGobi's
graphical user interface, providing a way to fluidly transition
between analysis and exploration, as well as automating common tasks.
It builds on the first version of rggobi to provide a more robust and
user friendly interface.

To install rggobi, you will need to first install GGobi by following
the instructions at http://www.ggobi.org/downloads/.  You get more
details, including an introductory vignette, at
http://www.ggobi.org/rggobi/.

There are some problems with rggobi on Intel Macs (we are working on a
solution), so please email me for more details if you are keen to try
it out.  We want rggobi to be a stable and useful tool, so please do
not hesitate to email me or the GGobi mailing list
(http://www.ggobi.org/support/) if you have any problems.

Regards,

Hadley

Subject: [R-pkgs] classifly 0.2.2
Message-ID: <f8e6ff050612060948g3fa18226pc2db548e477e1481@mail.gmail.com>

The classifly package uses rggobi to visualise classification
boundaries in high-dimensions.  Given p-dimensional training data
containing d groups (the design space), a classification algorithm
(classifier) predicts which group new data belongs to. Generally the
input to these algorithms is high dimensional, and the boundaries
between groups will be high dimensional and perhaps curvilinear or
multi-facted. This R package provides methods for visualising the
division of space between the groups.

More information and a paper describing the ideas can be found at
http://had.co.nz/classifly/.

Hadley

Subject: [R-pkgs] trip package on CRAN

 Hello,

 The 'trip' package provides extensions to the 'sp' spatial classes for 
animal track data.

 Trip objects are created from SpatialPointsDataFrame objects by 
specifying the columns containing ID and date-time data. Argos formats 
can be read directly, and there are functions for basic speed filtering 
and spatial gridding of time spent. Tight integration with 'sp' means 
that projections and general I/O can be handled using 'rgdal'. (This 
really is excellent and so I thank the developers of these and 
supporting packages).

Trip is intended for use with location data that are irregularly spaced 
in time - this contrasts with the rationale behind the traj class in 
'adehabitat'. Primarily it has been developed with marine animal data in 
mind, but the validation of trip classes used should general for many 
applications.

 There is a short vignette available from here -  it's not integrated 
into the CRAN-available package yet.
