Subject: [R-pkgs] gRaven package - Bayes Nets: 'RHugin' Emulation with
 'gRain'
Message-ID: <3877ec85-3309-fec1-5cd5-579f291d401f@bristol.ac.uk>

Dear all,

I am pleased to announce that CRAN now hosts my package gRaven.

This provides wrappers for functions in the 'gRain' package to emulate 
some 'RHugin' functionality, allowing the building of Bayesian networks 
consisting of discrete chance nodes incrementally - through adding 
nodes, edges and conditional probability tables, the setting of 
evidence, whether 'hard' (boolean) or 'soft' (likelihoods), and querying 
marginal joint probabilities and normalizing constants.

Computations will typically not be so fast as they are with 'RHugin', 
but this package should assist users without access to the commercial 
package 'Hugin' to use existing code written to use 'RHugin'.

I am open to extending the functionality of the package in future, in 
response to user demand.

regards,

Peter Green
