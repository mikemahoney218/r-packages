Subject: [R-pkgs] gRaven package - Bayes Nets: 'RHugin' Emulation with
 'gRain'
Message-ID: <3877ec85-3309-fec1-5cd5-579f291d401f@bristol.ac.uk>

Dear all,

I am pleased to announce that CRAN now hosts my package gRaven.

This provides wrappers for functions in the 'gRain' package to emulate 
some 'RHugin' functionality, allowing the building of Bayesian networks 
consisting of discrete chance nodes incrementally - through adding 
nodes, edges and conditional probability tables, the setting of 
evidence, whether 'hard' (boolean) or 'soft' (likelihoods), and querying 
marginal joint probabilities and normalizing constants.

Computations will typically not be so fast as they are with 'RHugin', 
but this package should assist users without access to the commercial 
package 'Hugin' to use existing code written to use 'RHugin'.

I am open to extending the functionality of the package in future, in 
response to user demand.

regards,

Peter Green

Subject: [R-pkgs] New CRAN package announcement: azlogr
References: <1506840172.8984.1673462516211.ref@mail.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <1506840172.8984.1673462516211@mail.yahoo.com>

I am excited to announce that `azlogr` is published on CRAN!
This package?enables logging in 'R' by extending the functionality of 'logger' package. There is an option to add additional custom meta-data while logging, which can sometimes be helpful.?Logging messages are displayed on console and optionally they are sent to 'Azure Log Analytics' workspace in real-time.
The package comes with a vignette, How to use azlogr, that (hopefully) provides a good introduction to using the functions for easy logging. Example usage below:
# Azure Log Analytics workspace id and shared key are fetched
# from environment variables.
Sys.setenv(AZ_LOG_ID = "<enter-your-Azure-Log-Analytics-workspace-id>")
Sys.setenv(AZ_LOG_KEY = "<enter-your-Azure-Log-Analytics-shared-key>")

library(azlogr)

# Optionally, add additional meta-data, `country` and `id`, to be collected
# while logging, on top of the default fields - 'level', 'time', 'msg'.
set_log_config(
  log_fields = c("level", "time", "msg"),
  additional_fields = list(country = "in", id = 123)
)

# Use logger_* functions with appropriate logging level to log.
# If POST is successful, then it will be available in custom log table on
# Azure Log Analytics, by default table name will be `log_from_r`_CL (_CL is
# added by Azure for any custom log table)
logger_info("log info sent to Azure")
#> {"level":"INFO","time":"2023-01-11 13:15:04","msg":"log info sent to Azure","country":"in","id":123}

# If the POST request is unsuccessful due to Azure credential issue, then log
# message is displayed on console and a warning is generated with error details.
logger_info("log info sent to Azure")
#> {"level":"INFO","time":"2023-01-11 13:15:04","msg":"log info sent to Azure","country":"in","id":123}
#> Warning message:
#> In logger_level(logger::INFO, ...) :
#>   Some error happened while sending POST request to 'Azure Log Analytics' workspace.
#> Error message: Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) :
#>   Could not resolve host: abcd.ods.opinsights.azure.com
Many thanks to the author of?'logger' package,?and to the CRAN team for a speedy onboarding!

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package - LGDtoolkit
Message-ID: <CABcwgRQ+UhisX0tPPgJt1WWpwvF2qT9rsP8B5FfvDzBP1LCwTw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

my new R package LGDtoolkit is now on CRAN.

The goal of this package is to cover the most common steps in Loss Given
Default (LGD) rating model development. The main procedures available are
those that refer to bivariate and multivariate analysis.
In particular two statistical methods for multivariate analysis are
currently implemented ? OLS regression and fractional logistic regression.
Both methods are also available within different blockwise model designs,
and both have customized stepwise algorithms. To cover other important
steps for LGD model development, it is recommended to use 'LGDtoolkit'
package along with 'PDtoolkit', and 'monobin' (or 'monobinShiny') packages.

With the next releases package will be extended with a new features. In
particular, validation procedures will be added, and significant part of
the package will be dedicated to the usage of survival analysis for LGD
modeling (extrapolation of LGD for incomplete recoveries, development of
risk differentiation function and collateral haircut modeling).

To check out the current package functionalities run
install.packages("LGDtoolkit") and help(package = "LGDtoolkit").
To stay up to date with new development features follow the github page:
https://github.com/andrija-djurovic/LGDtoolkit.

I hope some of you will find the package useful.

Kind regards,
Andrija

Hello everyone,

Our new package {clarify} has been released. {clarify} provides
simulation-based inference as an alternative to the delta method for
interpretable quantities derived from model parameters, like average
marginal effects, dose-response functions, and predictions at
representative values. Also provided are methods for combining such
quantities across multiply imputed datasets.

Those of you who have used Clarify for Stata or the retired R package
{Zelig} will find similar and expanded capabilities in {clarify}.

Install {clarify} using
install.packages("clarify")

Subject: [R-pkgs] Retirement/archiving of rgdal,
 rgeos and maptools October 2023
Message-ID: <6253c881-857b-bc97-2420-d612a3549a3e@reclus2.nhh.no>

The third report on the R-spatial evolution project has been published.

https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/04/10/evolution3.html

It links back to earlier blogs and presentations, and focuses on work that 
maintainers of R packages and workflows using rgdal, rgeos and maptools 
need to put in train now before the packages are archived on CRAN.

The first changes will occur in June 2023, and the retiring packages will 
be archived during October 2023. If you are giving a workshop or tutorial 
during the Northern hemisphere summer, aim for June.

If you still need more assistance after reading the project materials, 
raise an issue on https://github.com/r-spatial/evolution/issues or email 
me (issue better, less likely to be overlooked).

Subject: [R-pkgs] DNAmixturesLite and KinMixLite
Message-ID: <68d2e035-6cba-b6dd-71e8-872dc2ed1f12@bristol.ac.uk>

Dear all,

We are pleased to announce that CRAN now hosts our packages 
DNAmixturesLite and KinMixLite.

These are fully R-based versions of our packages DNAmixtures and KinMix, 
which rely on a commercial software, HUGIN, for performing efficient 
computations in Bayesian networks. The lite versions rely instead on 
gRain for such computations.

DNAmixtures provides statistical methods for DNA mixture analysis and 
has been used to provide statistical evidence pertaining to DNA in 
several criminal cases in the UK and Denmark. The purpose of the newly 
released lite version is to allow users without a HUGIN software license 
to experiment with the statistical methodology. While the lite version 
aims to provide full functionality, it is noticeably less efficient than 
the original DNAmixtures package. For details on implementation and 
methodology see <https://dnamixtures.r-forge.r-project.org/>.

KinMix builds upon DNAmixtures and is a toolbox of methods for inference 
about relationships between contributors to a DNA mixture and other 
individuals of known genotype: a basic example would be testing whether 
a contributor to a mixture is the father of a child of known genotype. 
KinMixLite builds upon DNAmixturesLite and provides most of the 
functionality of the KinMix package, but with some loss of efficiency. 
The package implements the methods introduced in Green, P. J. and 
Mortera, J. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.fsigen.2017.02.001> and Green, P. J. 
and Mortera, J. (2021) <doi:10.1111/rssc.12498>.

Message-ID: <8e6617ab-a4aa-4a9c-927d-133e0cd846e5@app.fastmail.com>

Dear all,

A new version of gsDesign2 (1.0.8) is now on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=gsDesign2). gsDesign2 enables fixed or group sequential design under non-proportional hazards and supports highly flexible enrollment, time-to-event, and time-to-dropout assumptions.

The key improvements in this version include refined naming conventions for options in the info_scale argument adhering to the tidyverse design guide, and bug fixes for computing the futility bounds. Please see the changelog (https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/news/) for details.

As the gsDesign2 package is still in its early stages, we're eager to continue refining its features and performance. We invite you to try out this new version and share your insights with us. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us develop a tool that meets the evolving needs of users.

Cheers,
-Nan

A new version of the sp package, 2.0-0, has been published on CRAN. This new version defaults to using the sf package rather than the rgdal package, and deprecates use  of the rgeos package. These changes are described in https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html, and lead up to the planned archiving of the retiring packages: maptools, rgdal and rgeos in October 2023. This version issues invasive start-up messages in order to alert users to impending changes; maintainers of affected packages have already been warned.

Message-ID: <f4414e37-3eb8-4933-8c80-40dff5371998@app.fastmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm thrilled to announce that a new version of gsDesign (3.5.0) is now on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=gsDesign). gsDesign supports group sequential clinical trial design, largely as presented in Jennison and Turnbull (2000).

The 3.5.0 update introduces some significant enhancements:

- New toInteger() function to convert gsDesign or gsSurv objects to integer sample size and event counts.
- New toBinomialExact() function to convert time-to-event bounds to exact binomial for studies with low event rates.
- New vignette on the fundamentals of asymptotics for group sequential design, and another vignette on the sequential probability ratio test for a single arm binary endpoint.

We have also improved compatibility with the latest ggplot2 version and have introduced a new hex sticker logo. For the complete list of updates, please see the changelog (https://keaven.github.io/gsDesign/news/).

Best regards,
-Nan

Subject: [R-pkgs] maptools, rgdal, rgeos and rgrass7 retiring Monday,
 October 16
Message-ID: <SV0P279MB04755A943724ADEE275CDEBCEEC4A@SV0P279MB0475.NORP279.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

The legacy R spatial infrastructure packages maptools, rgdal and rgeos will be archived by CRAN on Monday, October 16, 2023; rgrass7 has  already been replaced by rgrass and will be archived with the retiring packages. 

The choice of date matches the previously announced archiving during October 2023, and the specific date matches the release schedule of Bioconductor 3.18 (some Bioconductor packages depend on retiring packages).

sp_2.1-0 was published October 2, 2023, dropping all dependencies on the retiring packages. sp will continue to be available and maintained, but not developed further. Users of sp classes may continue to make use of them, but will have to use sf or terra to read, write or manipulate objects with coercion (for a guide to coercion, see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgrass/vignettes/coerce.html).

Information about the evolution project may be found in reports and resources at https://r-spatial.github.io/evolution/; a recent blog by Jakub Nowosad may also be useful as an overview of what has been going on: https://geocompx.org/post/2023/rgdal-retirement/. For more detail, see https://r-spatial.github.io/evolution/ogh23_bivand.html and a video recording of this presentation https://av.tib.eu/media/63141 (August 28).

All directly affected package maintainers have been alerted to the impending changes, some in December 2022, most others in March-April 2023. Many have already updated their packages on CRAN - thank you for your understanding! The remainder received github issue comments and email reminders in the last ten days, and will receive final notices to update by October 9. 

On R-universe, builds of packages archived on CRAN are dropped automatically (https://github.com/r-universe-org/help/issues/286). Read-only github mirrors of archived packages will remain available in principle while github exists (https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/568), for example https://github.com/cran/rgdal. Other binary builds (Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu) have been alerted; support at Anaconda has been alerted.

On CRAN, the retired packages will continue to be available as source packages on https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive. maptools, rgdal and rgeos also retain their R-forge repositories, which may be used to retrieve functions for adding to other packages.

A snapshot of Windows and macOS binary packages may be found on https://github.com/r-spatial/evolution/tree/main/backstore.

Please raise questions by replying to this post, or as issues on https://github.com/r-spatial/evolution.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Introducing the makeit package
Message-ID: <CANrWemj66YMZY-amVVzOAkoS-fCLNR2BNaPftj1mKzxX5oJ6Bw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R community,

Just a quick note about a new package on CRAN called makeit. Yesterday, I
added a vignette and released as 1.0.1:
https://cran.r-project.org/package=makeit
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/makeit/vignettes/makeit.html

It provides a simple but powerful function make() that works the same way
as GNU Make. In short, it runs an R script if underlying files have
changed, otherwise it does nothing. The first example in the vignette is:
  make("analysis.R", "input.dat", "output.dat")
The second example involves three scripts:
  make("01_model.R", "data.dat", "results.dat")
  make("02_plots.R", "results.dat", c("plots/A.png", "plots/B.png"))
  make("03_tables.R", "results.dat", c("tables/A.csv", "tables/B.csv"))

For R workflows, it can provide the same functionality as GNU Make but with
fewer software requirements in terms of software installed and system path.
The make calls() can be grouped together in a dedicated script, called
something like _make.R, or conveniently called from within scripts to
decide whether a certain part of the analysis needs to be (re)run or not.

Any feedback is appreciated, via email or GitHub issues
<https://github.com/arni-magnusson/makeit>.

Best regards,
Arni

P.S. I originally wanted to call the package simply 'make', but was
politely informed by the CRAN Team that this could mess with their
extensive makefile infrastructure. So there we have it, makeit :)
