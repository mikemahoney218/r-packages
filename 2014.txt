Subject: [R-pkgs] caret version 6.0-21
Message-ID: <CEED102E.1BF50%max.kuhn@pfizer.com>

The caret package (short for Classification And REgression
Training) attempts to streamline the process for creating
predictive models. The package contains tools for:

 - data splitting
 - pre-processing
 - feature selection
 - model tuning using resampling (with parallel processing)
 - variable importance estimation

as well as other functionality. The package website has lengthy
descriptions of functionality:

   http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/

A new version, 6.0-21, was just released to CRAN and contains
major improvements:

 - A new system for user-defined models has been added. See
  http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/custom_models.html.

 - When creating the grid of tuning parameter values, the column
  names no longer need to be preceded by a period. Periods can
  still be used as before but are not required.

 - trainControl now has a 'method = "none"' resampling option that
  bypasses model tuning and fits the model to the entire training
  set.

- Several new models were added, bringing the total number of
  models up to 149.

 - ggplot methods were added for several classes.

Most changes are not user-visible so that the impact on current
scripts should be minimal.

For this caret update, the AppliedPredictiveModeling package will be
brought up to date shortly with slightly modified scripts for the
analyses contained in the text.

Thanks to the R community and caret contributors: Jed Wing, Steve
Weston, Andre Williams, Chris Keefer, Allan Engelhardt, Tony Cooper,
Zachary Mayer and the R Core Team.

Subject: [R-pkgs] package JMbayes -- version 0.5-0
Message-ID: <7191AFC7255B4F49A30707E39BEAD05F3C83586A@EXCH-RX03.erasmusmc.nl>

*** Apologies for cross posting ***

Dear Colleagues, Dear R-users,

I would like to announce the release of the new version of package 
JMbayes available from CRAN (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=JMbayes). 
This package fits joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data 
under a Bayesian approach using MCMC. These models are applicable in 
mainly two settings. First, when focus is on the survival outcome and we 
wish to account for the effect of an endogenous (aka internal) 
time-dependent covariates measured with error. Second, when focus is on 
the longitudinal outcome and we wish to correct for nonrandom dropout.

Some basic features of the new version:

* The MCMC in now implemented with efficient custom-made code and no 
longer relies on JAGS, OpenBUGS or WinBUGS.

* The user can now specify her own density function for the longitudinal 
responses using argument 'densLong' (default is the normal pdf). Among 
others, this allows to fit joint models with categorical and 
left-censored longitudinal responses and robust joint models with 
Student's-t error terms. In addition, using the 'df.RE' argument, the 
user can also change the distribution of the random effects from 
multivariate normal to a multivariate Student's-t with prespecified 
degrees of freedom.

* The user has now the option to define custom transformation functions 
for the terms of the longitudinal submodel that enter into the linear 
predictor of the survival submodel (argument 'transFun'). For example, 
interactions terms, nonlinear terms (polynomials, splines), etc.

* The baseline hazard is now only estimated using B-splines (penalized 
(default) or regression).

* Dynamic predictions:

   - function survfitJM.JMbayes(), which computes dynamic survival 
probabilities, is now faster;

   - the new generic function aucJM() calculates time-dependent AUCs for 
joint models;

   - the new generic function dynCJM() calculates a dynamic 
discrimination index (weighted average of time-dependent AUCs) for joint 
models;

   - the new generic function prederrJM() calculates prediction errors 
for joint models;

   - the new function bma.combine() combines predictions using Bayesian 
model averaging; posterior model weights can be calculated using 
logLik.JMbayes() and marglogLik().

* a method has been added for the xtable() generic from package xtable 
for producing a LaTeX table with the results of the joint model.

* Backward-incompatible version; the aforementioned changes require 
refitting joint models that have been fitted with previous versions.


As always, any kind of feedback (e.g., questions, suggestions, 
bug-reports, etc.) is more than welcome.


Kind regards,

Dimitris

Subject: [R-pkgs] psych version 1.4.1
Message-ID: <47399D37-9704-4F26-AB3C-991E7CF809D0@northwestern.edu>

psych 1.4.1 is now on CRAN and being distributed to the mirrors.


? Substantial improvements in speed through the use of the parallel package and some coding improvements in a number of functions.
 ? Added parallel processing (multicores) to polychoric, tetrachoric, mixed.cor, fa, fa.parallel, cor.ci and alpha 
 ? With 2 cores this saves 50%, but this is not a linear function of the number of cores: with 4 cores the savings seems to be 67% and with 8 cores 75%. Requires the parallel package
 ? Modified ICLUST to increase speed by about 50% (does not require parallel). 
 ? Added splitHalf, omega2latex and ICC2latex 
 ? Added the ability to find scores automatically in omega. 
 ? A minor tweak to r.test to better report the call in the case of a correlated correlation. 
 ? A minor tweak to corr.test so that if all the sample sizes are the same, just report one number.
 ? Added the Gleser data set for an example of generalizability theory. 
 ? Added the ability data set (just the iqitems scored for correct/incorrect)
 ? Added the check option in describe (turning it off increases speed drastically, but at the risk of not detecting logical or factor data). 
 ? Added the describeData helper to do a quick pass to list the data types in a data.frame. 
 ? Added best.items and lookup as two helper functions for finding item contents from a dictionary of item names and contents.

What is psych?

A number of routines for personality, psychometrics and experimental psychology.   Functions are primarily for scale construction using factor analysis, cluster analysis and reliability analysis, although others provide basic descriptive statistics. Item Response Theory is done using  factor analysis of tetrachoric and polychoric correlations. Functions for simulating particular item and test structures are included. Several functions serve as a useful front end for structural equation modeling.  Graphical displays of path diagrams, factor analysis and structural equation models are created using basic graphics. Some of the functions are written to support a book on psychometrics as well as publications in personality research.

Subject: [R-pkgs] SPRINT 1.0.5 release (parallelised R functions for complex
 analysis and large data sets)
Message-ID: <20140130152204.166467mxiucvjnrw@www.staffmail.ed.ac.uk>

Dear All

We have recently released SPRINT v1.0.5. SPRINT provides parallelised  
versions of existing R functions (e.g. statistical, machine learning,  
utility) that often exceed computational limits (speed or memory) with  
large or complex data sets.


SPRINT 1.0.5 now:

-> runs on Mac OSX multi-cores (i.e. you may not need to obtain access  
to compute clusters)

-> provides a parallelised version of the Hamming distance (based on  
original version contained in stringdistmatrix() by M van der Loo, and  
parallelised differently from the option provided therein)

-> compliant with MPI3 (and the latest version of the mpich package)


Download and instructions available at www.r-sprint.org.

SPRINT 1.0.5 is not available on CRAN as we have not yet completed  
testing against the latest major release of R (3.0.x). However, we  
will release a small incremental update of SPRINT as version 1.0.6  
within the next few weeks that will be available via CRAN and will  
work with R3.


Notes:
- With the availability of SPRINT for Mac users, we hope to address  
computational issues that are too large or too slow for these users,  
but still small enough to not require a much larger number of nodes  
and cores (i.e. compute clusters or supercomputers like HECToR or  
ARCHER).
- We have parallelised the Hamming distance as from collaborators and  
course participants we know this to have potential in use for  
Next-Gen-Sequencing, e.g. measuring pairwise distances between  
nucleotide sequences. In principle, though, Hamming is a distance  
useful for string or binary data vectors.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Rcpp 0.11.0
Message-ID: <21232.20575.43733.265462@max.nulle.part>


A new release 0.11.0 of Rcpp is now on CRAN, bringing a key new feature as
well as a number of enhancements, extensions and and bug fixes to R ---
please see the announcement text below.

The key change is the fact that builds are now effectively 'header-only' and
no longer require packages to link against a library provided by the Rcpp
package. Instead, R's function registration mechanism is used.  This does
however mean that your current packages using Rcpp will break, so you need
rebuild all packages using Rcpp this one time.  Some details are below.

Dirk, on behalf of the Rcpp Core team




===== Summary =====

Version 0.11.0 of the Rcpp package is now on CRAN and its mirrors.  

This new release brings a number of new features, most noticably a simplified
build system, as well as improvements to existing features and bugfixes.

Complete details of the changes implemented between the last announcement for
version 0.10.0 and this new can be found in the NEWS and ChangeLog files
which are included in the package.



===== Overview =====

Rcpp is an R package and associated C++ library for seamless integration
between C++ and R.  

It has been described in a Journal of Statistical Software (2011, Vol 40,
Issue 08) paper (also included in the package as the "Rcpp-introduction" pdf
vignette) and a book "Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp" (2013,
Springer, useR! Series).

As of early 2014, Rcpp is used by over 160 other CRAN packages.

Several key features of the new 0.11.0 release are described below.



===== One-time rebuild required =====

Because of the simplified linking scheme detailed in the next section, and
the corresponding removal of the libRcpp.* library, all packages currently
using Rcpp need to be reinstalled.

We provide a simple helper script at
https://github.com/RcppCore/rcpp-logs/blob/master/scripts/showReverseRcppDepends.r
to identidy which of your currently-installed packages use Rcpp, and need to
be rebuilt / reinstalled.



===== Simpler Building with Rcpp =====

Thanks to the 'LinkingTo:' directive, R already instructed the compiler where
to fine header files when writing code with Rcpp. The package now uses the
registration facilities in R (see Section 5.4 in Writing R Extensions). 

With just an 'Imports: Rcpp' in DESCRIPTION along with an explicit import
statement in the NAMESPACE file such 'importFrom(Rcpp, evalCpp)' all required
Rcpp code will be properly instantiated without any explicit linking. [ Note
that just using 'import(Rcpp)' is not sufficient, but any exported C++
identifier should do -- evalCpp is nice and short. ]

This means that the package no longer provides a user-facing library
libRcpp.so (or libRcpp.dylib or libRcpp.dll).  This also implies that a
one-time rebuild is needed as alluded to in the previous section.

The key benefit is that many package should no longer require the files
src/Makevars and src/Makevars.win in order to link with Rcpp. Mny packages
will be able to retire these files. The exception, of course, is the case
where a package links against an external library as eg the RcppArmadillo
package> Here, the LAPACK / BLAS / Fortran libraries still need to be
linked. However, the corresponding values are also provided by R and the
expression becomes a simple 'PKG_LIBS=$(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS)'.



===== Rcpp attributes =====

Rcpp attributes were a key innovation in the 0.10.0; they have matured
further and have now become the standard way to build code with Rcpp.  See
the dedicated vignette for details.



==== C++11 Support =====

R 3.1.0, to be released in a few month, will permit compilation using C++11,
the newest C++ standard -- including for packages going to CRAN.  Rcpp had
already supported 'local' builds using C++11 since version 0.10.3, simply add

   [[Rcpp::plugins(cpp11)]]

and Rcpp attributes takes care of the rest.



===== Memory management =====

A number of internal data structures have been rewritten.

===== Support =====

Questions about Rcpp should be directed to the Rcpp-devel mailing list
    https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rcpp-devel

While we prefer the mailing list, StackOverflow has also become a frequently

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package: RoughSets (v1.0-0)
Message-ID: <52F26665.7050207@decsai.ugr.es>

Dear R users,

we are happy to announce that a new package, RoughSets, is available on CRAN at

http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RoughSets/index.html

It is a comprehensive package for rough set theory and fuzzy rough set theory, with a detailed manual and many demos showing it's use. Here is the description:

This package provides comprehensive implementations of the rough set theory (RST) and the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST), and integrates these two theories into a single package. It provides implementations, not only for the basic concepts of RST and FRST, but also most common methods based on them for handling some tasks such as discretization, feature selection, instance selection, rule induction, and prediction. RST was introduced by Zdzislaw Pawlak in 1982 as a sophisticated mathematical tool based on indiscernibility relations to model and process imprecise or incomplete information. It works on symbolic-valued datasets for tackling the data analysis problems. By using the indiscernibility relation for objects/instances, RST does not require additional parameters to analyze the data. FRST is an extension of RST. The FRST combines concepts of vagueness and indiscernibility that are expressed with fuzzy sets (as proposed by Zadeh, in 1965) and RST.

Any feedback is clearly welcome.

Kind regards,
Christoph

Message-ID: <CAMy00i2vHEZqWeHAprAXhad97eiuLMzPoLeEMrOiyD=OhtTGbg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

as I often have to visually divide my R output into blocks, especially
when I create R executable scripts, I created hrr in the hope that
this simple package might come in handy to you.
I released it to CRAN today.

It is a simple package to create and print fully customisable
horizontal rules that fits your terminal windows width.
It provides two functions:

- `hr` function to create and print horizontal rules
- `ncols` function to detect the number of terminal window columns and
optionally set the `width` option

Link to the package: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hrr/index.html

Its source code is located at https://github.com/leodido/hrr and issue
tracker at https://github.com/leodido/hrr/issues.

Please contact me (leodidonato at gmail.com) with any comments,
suggestions, and/or

Subject: [R-pkgs] rms package updated
Message-ID: <5315D446.8000808@vanderbilt.edu>

Changes are listed below.

NOTE: The next release of rms will replace the survfit.formula function 
with a new function named npsurv ("nonparametric survival estimates") so 
as to not conflict with the survival package.  This is a 
NON-DOWNWARD-COMPATIBLE change.  To get Kaplan-Meier estimates in the 
NEXT release use npsurv() instead of survfit().

The web site for more information about rms is 
http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/Rrms


Changes in version 4.1-3 (2014-03-02)
    * num.intercepts: removed (is in Hmisc)
	 * survfit.formula, cph, psm: changed to use inputAttributes attribute 
of Surv objects (introduced earlier in survival package so that rms 
could drop its customized Surv function)
    * Exported survfit.formula
    * Changed survival fitting functions and residuals to use units.Surv

Changes in version 4.1-2 (2014-02-28)
    * psm: Fixed bug to allow computation of Dxy with left censoring
    * val.prob: Fixed recently introduced bug that made calibration 
intercept and slope always 0,1.  Thanks: Lars.Engerstrom at lio.se
    * plot.Predict: added between to leave space between panels
    * orm.fit: fixed error in kmid calculation when heavy ties at first 
level of y.  Thanks: Yuwei Zhu
    * setPb: changed default to now use tktcl to show progress bars for 
simulations
    * predictrms: fixed bug with type='terms'
    * val.surv: handle case where survival estimates=0 or 1 when using 
log-log transform

Changes in version 4.1-1 (2014-01-22)
    * Removed use of under.unix in anova.rms, latex.summary, plot.nomogram
    * Removed use of oldUnclass, oldClass, is.category
    * Fixed class of Rq object; had failed with bootcov.  Thanks: Max Gordon
    * survplot: preserved par()
    * Srv: removed, changed all uses to Surv() for new survival package 
that preserves attributes for Surv inputs
    * survplot.survfit, survdiffplot: added conf='diffbands'
    * predictrms: fixed num. intercepts calculation order
    * survplot, survdiffplot: used original standard error for 
survdiffplot, and fun
    * dyx.cens: allow left-censoring

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package on CRAN: greport
Message-ID: <53166925.8050509@vanderbilt.edu>

The first submission of the new greport package is now on CTAN.  This 
package facilitates graphical reporting of clinical trials an is highly 
tied to LaTeX, Hmisc, and lattice.  It creates hyperlinks and pop-up 
tooltips in the resulting pdf report.  Tables are greatly de-emphasized, 
but hyperlinks take you from primary graphics to supporting tables in an 
appendix, which are hyperlinked back to the graphic.

The package's web page, with example pdf reports, is at

Dear R users,

We are pleased to inform you that version 2.0 of the MVN package has been released yesterday and it is available on CRAN now. 

This package contains three most widely used multivariate normality tests, including Mardia?s, Henze-Zirkler?s and Royston?s Multivariate Normality Tests. 
In addition these tests, our package has ability to create three multivariate plots. In the earlier version of the package, there was just one plot, which was chi-square Q-Q plot. Now, users can create two new multivariate plots, perspective and contour plots, for binary data sets. 

We have also added a vignette to the package for more depth information.

We are looking forward to getting your useful feedbacks to email selcuk.korkmaz at hacettepe.edu.tr

Best,

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package metap on CRAN
Message-ID: <Zen-1WPYmY-000EAo-RD@smarthost01b.mail.zen.net.uk>

This package provides meta-analysis of significance values.

Although the preferred way of performing meta-analysis uses effect 
sizes sometimes these are unavailable and only p-values can be 
obtained from the primary studies. The metap package provides several 
ways of synthesising p-values and a graphical display. There exist a 
number of packages on CRAN which use one or other of these techniques 
in the context of genetic studies but metap is designed for general 
purpose use.

Comments welcome.

Subject: [R-pkgs] new version of effects package
Message-ID: <web-502235909@cgpsrv2.cis.mcmaster.ca>

Dear all,

Sandy Weisberg, Michael Friendly, and I would like to announce a new version of the effects package, 3.0-0, now on CRAN; the new version should shortly percolate through the various CRAN mirrors. 

The major enhancement in this version of effects is the ability to plot partial residuals and smoothed partial residuals in effect displays for linear and generalized linear models, generalizing component-plus-residual plots. This new feature provides a visualization of the data against fitted terms in the model (or combinations of predictors) of arbitrary dimension and complexity. See the documentation for the partial.residuals argument in ?Effect and ?plot.eff.

As always, suggestions and reports of problems are appreciated.

Best,
 John

Subject: [R-pkgs] Rcpp11 3.1.0 is on CRAN.
Message-ID: <324CDF70-7468-4A9D-9950-93A809CFB527@r-enthusiasts.com>

Hello, 

R version 3.1.0 was released yesterday, and as always is welcome with great pleasure. One
of the features that is of particular interest to me is the support for C++11. 
I would encourage you to read 
[Writing R Extensions](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Using-C_002b_002b11-code)
to familiarize yourself with 
what this supports means and how to take advantage of it. C++11 is a major 
upgrade of the C++ standard, making C++ more expressive, more efficient, more
fun to use and teach. It almost feels like a new language if you embrace it fully. 
The standards committee has done a great job of maintaining compatibility, which means
that code written with older standard will still compile and work. 
However, with C++11 code you write today and tomorrow will not be the same as code 
you used to write with C++98. 

To get the best of what C++11 has to offer, I'm releasing Rcpp11 today. Rcpp11
is a complete redesign of Rcpp, focused on C++11. Rcpp11 is a header only 
C++ library, distributed as an R package on CRAN, that facilitates embedding 
C++ code in R packages. 

I'll try to keep this announcement short. More details will follow on dedicated 
channels. I will just highlight a few aspects of Rcpp11 that are high level 
enough for such an annoucement. 

Header Only
===========

Rcpp11 is header only -- it consists only of a set of `.h` files. Rcpp11 has no
`.cpp` files, and no R functions. This eliminates many problems inherent to 
binary compatibility that Rcpp has been fighting with for years. 

The recommended way to use Rcpp11 is to have these lines in the `DESCRIPTION` file 
of your package: 

```
LinkingTo: Rcpp11
SystemRequirements: C++11
```

Modernized code base
====================

Many features of the original Rcpp code base are the consequence of my 
learning C++ and the internal API of R. After a few years of experience, I can 
now admit that mistakes were made while designing it. Unfortunately for reasons
outside of my control, it is not possible to fix these mistakes under the umbrella
of the Rcpp package. 

Things are radically different for Rcpp11, which I will maintain. Over the past 
few months, I have considered many features of the code base and either decided
to abandon them or upgrade them to the level of expectation we should have for a 
modern R/C++ interface. 


API
---

Most of what is usually called the API has been retained. I do not guarantee
low level compatibililty, but there is conceptual compatibility. For example, 
Rcpp11 contains all the classes we would expect: `NumericVector`, `List`, ...

I'm not going into details about what the individual differences are. Instead I 
will start documenting how to use the API provided by Rcpp11. 


Attributes
----------

Attributes is probably the best feature that has ever been contributed to Rcpp. It 
gives a mechanism for decorating C++ functions, parsing these decorations and generating
scaffolding code around them.  

This feature has not been retained in Rcpp11, but instead has been moved into a 
new package called [attributes](https://github.com/Rcpp11/attributes), 
which is being developed and will be released later. 

It is worth mentioning that code generated by Rcpp's `compileAttributes` function
should be compilable against Rcpp11. When attributes becomes available it will 
provide a more flexible approach, and provide facilities for package authors to
implement and use their own attributes.


Modules
-------

Rcpp modules was not retained as part of Rcpp11. This was a hard decision, because
I invested a lot of time developing the original code behind Rcpp modules. However
modules have significant problems which make them hard to maintain. Modules are 
also very demanding on the compiler. 

However, I still believe that the promise of Rcpp modules -- exposing C++ classes 
at the R level -- is very worthwhile. My plan is to redesign it using a different 
approach, more oriented towards code generation, ? la attributes. 


Time and Date classes
---------------------

I decided to abandon the classes responsible to handling dates and times. Better 
classes might be introduced when I'm comfortable with the design. Design 
documents and pull requests are welcome. 


Further discussion
==================

Please consider subscribing to the R and C++ mailing list that was created a few 
days ago: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/r-and-cpp

The scope of the mailing list is broader, the intention is to discuss all things 
R and C++. Questions about Rcpp11, Rcpp or anything related to using C++ and R
are welcome. As of today, 37 participants are registered. Please consider 
replying to this annoucement email through the mailing list. 

Rcpp11 is developed through the Rcpp11 organisation on github. Feel free
to report issues and submit pull requests. https://github.com/Rcpp11/Rcpp11


Versioning
==========

The pattern that has been decided for versions of Rcpp11 is to use the same 
number as the mininum version of R required. Therefore this initial version
is Rcpp11 3.1.0 and interim releases might be called 3.1.0.1, 3.1.0.2, etc ...

Documentation
=============

There is no documentation yet. I personally find the heterogeneous sources
of documentation for Rcpp to be confusing. I have three goals in terms of 
documentation for Rcpp11:

 - An article is being written. This will be a casual introduction to 
   interesting features of C++11 and Rcpp11.
 - API documentation. My goal is to have a website that will make easy to 
   browse internal documentation (what to do with a NumericVector, ...) similar
   to cplusplus.com or something. 
 - I have started working on a R and C++ book. As I personally consider that 
   C++ = C++11 from now on, the book will mainly cover uses cases of Rcpp11. 

I hope to that between now and useR this year, I will make progress on the 2 first 
items of the previous list. 

Licensing
=========

Rcpp11 is licensed under the MIT license.

Future
======

This is the first release, it has required a lot of time and effort from me and
Kevin Ushey who has stepped in as a regular contributor to the package. 

This sets us with a new foundation for interfacing R and C++ for years to come. 
Many features of C++11 such as regular expressions and threads have not been 
leveraged yet with this initial release. 

C++ is more alive than ever, a new minor update of the standard is likely to 
be released this year and supported at day 0 by popular compilers. At this point
I do not anticipate to start working on a Rcpp14 package. 

In a few years (the ETA is currently 2017), a new major version of the C++ standard
will be released. It is too soon to say if it will be worthwhile to have a Rcpp17, 
but from a casual reading of the expected features, I'd say it is likely. 

I sincerely hope you will enjoy working with Rcpp11.

Romain

Subject: [R-pkgs] Updates to Hmisc, rms, and greport packages
Message-ID: <534F19F1.1050905@vanderbilt.edu>

The Hmisc package has had a number of updates/fixes:

Changes in version 3.14-4 (2014-04-13)
    * rcspline.eval: stop new logic for ignoring outer values when there 
are many ties when there are also many ties on interior values.  Added 
new logic to use interior unique values of x when the number of unique x 
is small.
    * latexBuild: generalized with insert argument
    * latex.default: modified to use mods of latexBuild, fixed bug with 
caption.loc='bottom' (thanks: YacineH)
    * latex.default: fixed bug where comma did not appear after 
caption={} for ctable (thanks: Johannes Hofrichter)
    * tests: fit.mult.impute.bootstrap.r: added new example (thanks: 
Jane Cook)
    * fit.mult.impute: added call for fit.mult.impute in returned 
object, replacing call from fitter; makes update work for fit.mult.impute
    * summary.formula: fixed recognition of multiple left-hand-side 
variables to trigger call to summaryM (thanks: Kevin Thorpe)
    * summaryM: changed group label to '' instead of 0 for formulas like 
age + sex ~ 1
    * Ecdf: added what argument to all functions
    * nobsY: return constructed id vector
    * addMarginal: instead of .marginal. being logical, make it contain 
names of variables being marginalized over
    * mChoice.c: fixed some inconsistencies

The rms package has also had some changes, and the survfit.formula 
function has been REMOVED, replaced by the npsurv function:

Changes in version 4.2-0 (2014-04-13)
    * Deprecated survfit.formula so would not overlap with function in 
survival
    * Added function npsurv, survplot.npsurv
    * REMOVED survfit.formula
    * Used new type argument to label.Surv for fitting functions
    * cph: added weights argument to residuals.coxph (Thanks: Thomas Lumley)
    * survfit.cph: fixed bug in using wrong type variable.  Thanks: 
Zhiyuan Sun
    * cph: added weighted=TRUE in call to residuals.coxph (Thanks: T Lumley)
    * orm.fit: improved ormfit to not try to deal with NaN in V, 
assuming that step-halving will happen

Some improvements have been made in the greport package:

Changes in version 0.5-1 (2014-04-15)
    * survReport: changed to use npsurv instead of survfit.formula
	 * exReport: changed order of output so that analysis of randomized 
patients marked for exclusions appears last; use LaTeX chngpage package 
to allow detailed table to go into left margin so as to be centered on page
    * exReport: added adjustwidth argument
	 * accrualReport: allowed enrollment target N to be omitted
    * exReport: fine tuning
    * nriskReport: new report to show number of subjects still being 
followed at each day
	 * Merge: added support for data.table
    * nriskReport: added id() variable
    * exReport: fixed bug when there is an exclusion with 0 frequency
    * accrualReport: improved graphics formatting, added minrand argument
    * accrualReport: added enrollmax argument, clarified notation
    * exReport: added ignoreExcl, ignoreRand arguments
    * all: added greportOption texwhere; default is 'gentex'; can 
specify texwhere='' to write non-appendix LaTeX code to console as for knitr
    * dReport: for byx for discrete Y, sense when Y is binary and use 
Wilson interval instead of bootstrap; adjust SE using confidence 
interval if proportion is 0 or 1
    * dReport: changed discreteness non-binary classification to use 
maximum number of unique values or Y instead of minimum
    * add globalVariables call to nriskReport

Message-ID: <CAMTWbJgf8Ts96RDca7PCP=+ZXaad=sf1WVk1AaAZRTmeAmEYVg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

The recently released version of the sampleSelection package [1] has
the version number 1.0, because we consider the package now to be
mature and feature-complete. Compared to version 0.6 of the
sampleSelection package (which is described in an article in the
Journal of Statistical Software [2]), the new version has, for
instance, following new features:

* estimation of binary-outcome selection models

* probit models, tobit-2 models, and binary-outcome selection models
can now be estimated with observation-specific weights

* predict() methods for calculating unconditional and conditional expectations

* improved/extended residuals() methods

* logLik() methods

* nobs() and nObs() methods

* default df.residual() method works

* removed the deprecated function tobit2()

Any kind of feedback is--as always--very welcome, preferable via R-Forge [3]!

Best regards,
Ott and Arne

Subject: [R-pkgs] icd9 - a new R package
Message-ID: <CA+zP7HEU9Ny4_t4kDS=CFwPM5KhQ3nyMUOGMDCZ8HM3miFDgWg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R people,

The new packge 'icd9' provides a range of tools for working with ICD-9-CM codes.

http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/icd9/index.html
https://github.com/jackwasey/icd9

ICD-9 (clinical modification) is primarily used for categorizing
diseases in the USA for hospital administration, whereas ICD-10 is
used by the rest of the world for disease surveillance. This package
is currently restricted to ICD-9-CM codes.

I've seen other R code which manipulates ICD-9 codes, but the mistake
is often made of thinking they are numeric. This is not the case, e.g.
100.0 is different from 100 and 100.00 . This package takes care of
validating these codes, explaining them (converting code to plain
English), comparing them, and attributing codes to groups of codes to
assign co-morbidities to patients. ICD-9 codes are often provided in a
shortened format without a decimal place, and these have distinct
validation rules. Functions to convert between decimal and short forms
are provided. All key parts use vectorized code, and comorbidities for
a million patient visits can be assigned in a few seconds on a modest
workstation.

SAS code is published by AHRQ to allow assignment of ICD-9 codes to
comorbidities. This package contains some SAS source to R code
translation, so that the canonical ICD-9-CM to comorbidity mapping
provided by AHRQ can be derived directly without the cumbersome and
error-prone manual task of re-encoding the relationships in R. I
believe a SAS to R converter was an April Fools' joke some time ago,
but this is indeed a very limited answer to that problem.
http://www.biostatistics.dk/sas2r/index.html

A short vignette covers the major use-cases.
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/icd9/vignettes/icd9.pdf

The code is supported by a fairly thorough test suite, and is well
documented in the hope that it will be easier for users of the package
to understand it, and to get involved. I chose only to export key
functions where I had thought carefully about the external API, but
all internal functions are documented and contain potentially useful
nuggets for power users.

Comments and contributions are most welcome. In particular, I'd love
to see unit tests corresponding to any failures you may encounter
working with your own ICD-9 data.

Hope you find this useful.
Jack

Subject: [R-pkgs] rPref - new package for preferences and Skylines
Message-ID: <53E0B671.8000801@p-roocks.de>

rPref is a new package for Skyline computation and some slight 
generalizations (database preferences).

The Skyline of a dataset selects tuples which are Pareto-optimal with 
respect to given optimization goals. Only those tuples are returned, 
which are not dominated by any other tuple. A tuple dominates another 
tuple if it is better than another tuple in all relevant dimensions 
(strictly better at least in one dimension).

rPref offers efficient Skyline computation (algorithms are in C++) and 
some related stuff (e.g. maxima of other preference orders, top-k 
preference selection, some tools for visualization).

Find more information and examples at: http://www.p-roocks.de/rpref

Feel free to send a mail to me for suggestions, bug reports, etc.

Patrick

Subject: [R-pkgs] New R package ``bvarsv''
Message-ID: <5412ABA6.5080808@gmail.com>

Dear R users,

please let me draw your attention to my new R package bvarsv (on CRAN 
since August 28) which implements the Primiceri (Review of Economic 
Studies, 2005) vector autoregressive model. The model is popular in 
macroeconomic analysis as it allows to model instabilities (e.g. in the 
mean and volatility dynamics) that are often observed in macroeconomic 
time series like inflation.

The package provides functionality for Bayesian analysis of the 
Primiceri model. To the best of my knowledge, it is the only publicly 
available R code to do so. The underlying Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
algorithm is computationally challenging, since each iteration requires 
multiple calls of a recursive Kalman filter type algorithm. Therefore, 
bvarsv relies on C++ code ported to R via Rcpp and RcppArmadillo. The 
clear focus of the package is on forecasting, as opposed to structural 
analysis of economic relationships. The package allows to compute 
posterior predictive distributions, which can then be plotted and 
analyzed using forecast evaluation techniques. More detailed 
documentation and examples is available here:

https://sites.google.com/site/fk83research/code

Your feedback on any aspects of the package, as well as possible 
improvements or extensions, would be highly appreciated.

Thank you and best wishes,
Fabian Kr?ger

Subject: [R-pkgs] Announce: Lahman baseball database archive package, v 3.0
Message-ID: <5415A900.8000406@yorku.ca>

Dear list

Version 3.0-1 of the Lahman package was recently submitted to CRAN. It 
contains the
the tables from Sean Lahman's  Baseball Database,
http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/
as a set of R data.frames with examples of use.

V 3.0 provides the updated data on pitching, hitting and fielding 
performance and other tables from 1871
through 2013, as recorded in the 2014 version of the database.  The 
Lahman project has a home page
at http://lahman.r-forge.r-project.org/ with some additional examples.  
Additional links to other
applications or analyses of this database are invited.

If you have used the earlier v. 2.0-x package in scripts or examples, 
please note that the database schema
has been somewhat revised to regularize the use of player ID variables 
across the various tables, and
remove some redundant variables, so some scripts may need to be 
revised.  In particular:

   o HallOfFame$hofID is now HallOfFame$playerID
   o managerID is now playerID in all tables
   o Removed from Master: managerID, hofID, holtzID, lahmanID, 
lahman40ID, lahman45ID, nameNote, nameNick, and college

-Michael

Subject: [R-pkgs] RMOA data stream modelling using MOA (Massive Online
	Analysis)
Message-ID: <CAJ9GNa=7X6YDaCFu3JOHdg2S15_VKUvdGaUkWiQ73Z7jBhcD7w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R community,

For users interested in streaming classification or building classification
models with limited amounts of RAM on your whole data set, I would like to
announce the release of a new package called RMOA on CRAN (
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMOA).

MOA is the most popular open source framework for data stream mining and is
being developed at the University of Waikato: http://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz.
RMOA interfaces with MOA version 2014.04 and focusses on building streaming
classification & regression models on data streams (the stream package in R
already allows clustering).

Classification models which are possible through RMOA are:

- Classification trees:
  * AdaHoeffdingOptionTree
  * ASHoeffdingTree
  * DecisionStump
  * HoeffdingAdaptiveTree
  * HoeffdingOptionTree
  * HoeffdingTree
  * LimAttHoeffdingTree
  * RandomHoeffdingTree
- Bayesian classification:
  * NaiveBayes
  * NaiveBayesMultinomial
- Active learning classification:
  * ActiveClassifier
- Ensemble (meta) classifiers:
  * Bagging
      + LeveragingBag
      + OzaBag
      + OzaBagAdwin
      + OzaBagASHT
  * Boosting
      + OCBoost
      + OzaBoost
      + OzaBoostAdwin
  * Stacking
      + LimAttClassifier
  * Other
      + AccuracyUpdatedEnsemble
      + AccuracyWeightedEnsemble
      + ADACC
      + DACC
      + OnlineAccuracyUpdatedEnsemble
      + TemporallyAugmentedClassifier
      + WeightedMajorityAlgorithm

Interfaces are implemented to model data in standard files (csv, txt,
delimited), ffdf data (from the ff package), data.frames and matrices.

Documentation of MOA directed towards RMOA users can be found at
http://jwijffels.github.io/RMOA/
Examples on the use of RMOA can be found in the documentation, on github at
https://github.com/jwijffels/RMOA or e.g. by viewing the showcase at
http://bnosac.be/index.php/blog/32-rmoa-massive-online-data-stream-classifications-with-r-a-moa

I you have any remarks or requests, don't hesitate to get into contact.

stream on,
Jan
