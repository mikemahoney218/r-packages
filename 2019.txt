Subject: [R-pkgs] New package qrandom: True random numbers
Message-ID: <bb46e0cb-9326-f7de-c118-043d18b543b8@gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
I would like to introduce a new package for R which is available on CRAN
now:

qrandom: True Random Numbers using the ANU Quantum Random Numbers Server

Note:
(1) This package generates true random numbers and can be used as an
alternative for RANDOM.ORG.
(2) There is absolutely no limit on how many true random numbers one may
retrieve.
(3) A sequence up to 100,000 true random integers or hexadecimal numbers
per single request is possible and data is whether a sequence, uniform
distribution or normal distribution.

Description:
It provides an interface to the ANU Quantum Random Number Generator
<https://qrng.anu.edu.au/index.php> provided by the Australian National
University. True random numbers are generated in real-time by measuring
the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. The electromagnetic field of the
vacuum exhibits random fluctuations in phase and amplitude at all
frequencies. By carefully measuring these fluctuations, one is able to
generate ultra-high bandwidth random numbers. The quantum Random Number
Generator is based on the papers by Symul et al., (2011)
<https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3597793> and Haw, et al. (2015)
<https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.3.054004>. The package offers
functions to retrieve a sequence of random integers or hexadecimals and
true random samples from a normal or uniform distribution.

The R package is available via
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qrandom/index.html
If you like to access the developmental version:
https://github.com/skoestlmeier/qrandom

Best regards,
Siegfried K?stlmeier (Ph.D. student in Finance at the University of
Regensburg)

Message-ID: <CABmqZHOBdG0hpdPAvw5AcmBK8HmPQeme8OeTKzi3QFvp=m9NvA@mail.gmail.com>

The new 1.4 version of depmixS4 has an important (and much requested!) new
feature: the possibility to request standard errors of estimated parameters
through the use of a finite differences approximation of the hessian. As
this is a critical feature we appreciate your comments and feedback when
using the beta version of this package available from r-forge:
https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=148
which can be installed using:
*install.packages("depmixS4", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org
<http://R-Forge.R-project.org>")*

As soon as enough testing has been done and we are confident about the
robustness of this new functionality we will post the package to CRAN.

Happy mixing, Ingmar Visser & Maarten Speekenbrink

Subject: [R-pkgs] MANOVA for collinear responses with rotation testing
 (ffmanova) + Synthetic data (RegSDC)
Message-ID: <mailman.1098.2.1548318082.8483.r-packages@r-project.org>

Hi,

Package ffmanova originally released on CRAN in 2006 has now been updated to Version 1.0. It has been a stable working horse and the changes are cosmetic.

Package RegSDC (Version: 0.2.0) is a new package on CRAN. The two packages are theoretically related and both make use of conditioned multivariate normal simulations - rotation testing in ffmanova and synthetic data generation in RegSDC.

Package ffmanova is mainly meant as a package for multivariate responses, but it also involves a general contribution to ANOVA testing in linear models. The approach to sums of squares (Type II*) is invariant to scale changes of continuous variables and pitfalls are avoided. Try to run code below.


ffmanova: Fifty-Fifty MANOVA

General linear modeling with multiple responses (MANCOVA). An overall p-value for each model term is calculated by the 50-50 MANOVA method by Langsrud (2002) <https://10.1111/1467-9884.00320>, which handles collinear responses. Rotation testing, described by Langsrud (2005) <https://10.1007/s11222-005-4789-5>, is used to compute adjusted single response p-values according to familywise error rates and false discovery rates (FDR). The approach to FDR is described in the appendix of Moen et al. (2005) <https://10.1128/AEM.71.4.2086-2094.2005>. Unbalanced designs are handled by Type II sums of squares as argued in Langsrud (2003) <https://10.1023/A:1023260610025>. Furthermore, the Type II philosophy is extended to continuous design variables as described in Langsrud et al. (2007) <https://10.1080/02664760701594246>. This means that the method is invariant to scale changes and that common pitfalls are avoided.


RegSDC: Information Preserving Regression-Based Tools for Statistical Disclosure Control

Information Preserving Regression-Based Tools for Statistical Disclosure Control
Implementation of the methods described in the paper with the above title: Langsrud, ?. (2019) <https://10.1007/s11222-018-9848-9>. Open view-only version at <https://rdcu.be/bfeWQ>. The package can be used to generate synthetic or hybrid continuous microdata, and the relationship to the original data can be controlled in several ways.


Best,
?yvind Langsrud

z100 <- z + 100  # change of scale (origin)
x100 <- x + 100  # change of scale (origin)

library(ffmanova)

# Type III depends on scale
Anova(lm(y ~ factor(x) * z), type = 3)
Anova(lm(y ~ factor(x) * z100), type = 3)

# Even Type II depends on scale
Anova(lm(y ~ x + I(x^2)), type = 2)
Anova(lm(y ~ x100 + I(x100^2)), type = 2)

# Type II* within ffmanova is invariant
ffmanova(y ~ x100 + I(x100^2))
ffmanova(y ~ z * (x100 + I(x100^2)))

# Type I for comparison
anova(lm(y ~ x100 + I(x100^2)))  # same as ffmanova
anova(lm(y ~ z * (x100 + I(x100^2))))  # but here z is significant

Subject: [R-pkgs] permuco: permutation tests and multiple comparisons.
Message-ID: <94c8e48ca3944046a7e0936151bb58ad@unige.ch>

Hello everyone,

We present you the permuco package, which has 2 main purposes: PERmutation tests and MUltiple COmparisons.

First, the package has functions for permutation tests for parameters in linear models with nuisance variables. Several permutation methods exist in the literature to reduce the effect of nuisance variables and the permuco package allows to use them for t statistics in regression model, F tests in type 3 ANOVA, and F tests in repeated measures ANOVA. The 2 functions aovperm() and lmperm() perform these tests and their usage is similar to the parametric counterpart aov() and lm().

Secondly, it uses multiple comparisons procedures with permutation tests to compare signals time by time. This problem is common when analysing electroencephalography (or fMRI) data where the response variables are EEG signals recorded for each experimental setting. In these experiments, the number of tests is equal to the number of time points of the signal which is typically in the thousands. The permuco package implements the state-of-the-art multiple comparisons procedures which uses permutations, like the cluster-mass test or the threshold-free cluster-enhancement. These procedures are powerful when the effects appear in clusters and they will control the family wise error rate (FWER) under the null hypothesis.

All these procedures are explained and exemplified in detail in a vignette.

We are waiting for your feedback in order to improve the next releases of permuco.

Message-ID: <001d01d4e0a4$31a9d8a0$94fd89e0$@sowi.uni-kl.de>

Dear R users,

Are you worried about the parallel trends assumption in your panel
regression? Use fixed effects individual slope models, controlling for
heterogeneous trends!

I am very pleased to announce that the package feisr is now available on
CRAN!

CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/package=feisr
GitHub: https://github.com/ruettenauer/feisr

The packages feisr provides a function to estimate fixed effects individual
slope (FEIS) models. FEIS models constitute a more general version of the
often used conventional fixed effects (FE) panel models. In contrast to
conventional fixed effects models, data are not person ?demeaned?, but
'detrended? by the predicted individual slope of each person or group, which
relaxes the assumptions of parallel trends between treated and untreated
groups.

We are happy about any comments or feedback!

Best regards,
Tobias

Subject: [R-pkgs] arsenal v3.0.0: An Arsenal of 'R' Functions for
 Large-Scale Statistical Summaries
Message-ID: <b23057$bcgv6f@ironport10.mayo.edu>

I'm pleased to announce the release of the "arsenal" package v3.0.0 on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=arsenal)!

"arsenal" has experienced some major growth in the last few months, starting with the release of v2.0.0 in January.  We tried to maintain backwards compatibility wherever possible, but had to eliminate it in some places.  With that said, here's the latest and greatest of "arsenal":


1.      The compare() function was renamed to comparedf(), to avoid conflicts with the "testthat" package.  comparedf() is used to compare two data.frames, and now includes additional functionality to specify which variables should be compared if they have different column names.

2.      tableby() is our Table-1-like function.  It now accepts a strata term and multiple left-hand-side terms.

3.      paired() piggybacks off of tableby() for comparisons across two time points.

4.      modelsum() runs [lm, coxph, glm, etc.] models on multiple variables, adjusted for the same covariates.  It also accepts a strata term and multiple left-hand-side terms.

5.      freqlist() generates frequency tables, much like SAS's "proc freq" with the "list" option.  It, too, accepts a strata term and multiple left-hand-side terms.

6.      write2html(), write2pdf(), and write2word() are capable of outputting tables to documents without needing to open a whole new .Rmd script.

7.      formulize() is a useful function for creating formulas from character vectors (or columns of data.frames).

As always, contributions and bug reports are welcome on arsenal's GitHub page: https://github.com/eheinzen/arsenal

Cheers!

Subject: [R-pkgs] new R packages for phylogenetic compartive methods
Message-ID: <AsoSsBYvyQ3-whlaUhLe6ss2y4wN83_AbvZlytyiScQLUqcyMgHh60TmpsQnpJ7_FNLRU-6BdHFFA3pmKh5m6Hs4kYWCte3dks7mLO53lDw=@protonmail.ch>

Dear all,
I wanted to let you know about four phylogenetic comparative methods (PCM) packages that have become available on (3 on CRAN and 1 on GitHub) recently that hopefully will be interesting to somebody. Three of them go significantly beyond the Brownian motion (BM) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes.

1) There is a new version of mvSLOUCH available. The most important change is that
the inference engine has been completely rewritten. Instead of directly evaluating the multivariate normal density formula it uses the PCMBase (R package, see below) to obtain the value of the likelihood in linear (in number of tip species) instead of quadratic time. Furthermore, as there is no need to store the between-species-between-traits variance covariance matrix much larger clades, then previously can be handled. From the user's perspective the main changes are the interface and increased functionality:
a) the phylogeny has to be now in the phylo (instead of ouch) format,
b) the trait data has to be a matrix (and not a data frame),
c) the package can automatically compare multiple models (BM, OUOU, OUBM and different assumed structures on the drift and diffusion matrices of the multivariate OU procees), function  estimate.evolutionary.model(), and return the one with the lowest AICc (the set of models to consider can either be automatically generated or user defined, see generate.model.setups()),
d) the user can set entries of the OU model's parameters to desired values (e.g. 0) and this will be fixed through the whole estimation,
e) a number of control parameters to be passed to the estimation procedure and optim() are available for the user to manipulate

2) PCMFit: the goal of PCMFit is to provide a generic tool for inference and selection of phylogenetic comparative models (PCMs). Currently, the package implements Gaussian and mixed Gaussian phylogenetic models (MGPM) over all tree types (including non-ultrametric and polytomic trees). The package supports non-existing traits or missing measurements for some of the traits on some of the species. The package supports specifying measurement error associated with each tip of the tree or inferring a measurement error parameter for a group of tips. The Gaussian phylogenetic models include various parametrizations of Brownian motion (BM) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) multivariate branching processes. The mixed Gaussian models represent models with shifts in the model parameters as well as the type of model at points of the tree. Each shift-point is described as a pair of a shift-node and associated type of model (e.g. OU or BM) driving the trait evolution from the beginning of the branch leading to the shift-node toward the shift-node and its descendants until reaching a tip or another shift-point. The function PCMFit is used to fit a given PCM or a MGPM for a given tree with specified shift-points. The function PCMFitMixed is used to fit an ensemble of possible MGPMs over a tree for which the shift-points are unknown. This function can perform model selection of the best MGPM for a given tree and data according to an information loss function such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The package has been thoroughly tested and applied to real data in the related research article entitled "Automatic Generation of Evolutionary Hypotheses using Mixed Gaussian Phylogenetic Models" (currently in review). Currently, the package is available from https://github.com/venelin/PCMFit . The web-page https://venelin.github.io/PCMFit/ provides access to documentation and related resources.

3) PCMBase: the computational engine that mvSLOUCH uses. Given a phylogeny (phylo format), traits' (multivariate) measurements and a user provided model of the traits' evolution the package calculates the likelihood. The family of allowed models is rather general. The package can handle any model for which lineages after speciation do not interact and the density of the transition along a branch is:
i) Gaussian
ii) the mean at the end of the branch depends linearly on the trait value at the start of the branch
iii) the covariance matrix does not depend on the value at the start of the branch
The likelihood is calculated in linear in number of tip species time.
The package is described in
Venelin Mitov, Krzysztof Bartoszek, Georgios Asimomitis, Tanja Stadler (2018).
Fast likelihood evaluation for multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods: the PCMBase R package

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package to query  the OpenTripPlanner (OTP) API
Message-ID: <AM0PR04MB62917659F74A2A29392EF3E2E92D0@AM0PR04MB6291.eurprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Dear all

A new R package 'otpr' is now available on CRAN. It's a wrapper for the OpenTripPlanner (OTP) API and is primarily aimed at researchers and transport planners who want to use OTP to carry out accessibility studies or generate variables for transport models. The package consists of four main functions:

otp_connect() - defines and tests the connection to an OTP instance.
otp_get_distance() - gets the distance in metres between an origin and destination on the street and/or path network by specified mode. 
otp_get_times() - in its simplest use case gets the journey time between an origin and destination by specified mode(s). It can also return more detailed information, breaking down the journey by transit time, walking time, waiting time and the number of transfers. 
otp_get_isochrone() - returns one or more travel time isochrones for a location in GeoJSON format. These can be generated either from or to the specified location. 

The package currently supports a subset of the parameters that are available for the OTP 'planner' and 'isochrone' API resources. This is based on my experience of using OTP to generate this type of data and to keep the functions relatively simple from the user perspective. For a future release I will be allowing a larger range of parameters to be optionally passed through to the API query, giving greater flexibility but still keeping the external functions simple for users who don't need such detailed control. 

For more information, including code examples, take a look at the GitHub repository for the package: 

https://github.com/marcusyoung/otpr
 
I also have an OTP intermediate level tutorial - 'creating and querying your own multi-modal route planner' -  which incorporates use of the package:

https://github.com/marcusyoung/otp-tutorial

I'd welcome any feedback as well as suggestions for future development. 

Best wishes

Marcus

Dear R-users:

First, we apologize for possible crossed messages.

It is a pleasure for us to have the opportunity to present a new R package, called 'spsur' available in  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spsur/index.html

This is a specific R package for the estimation of Spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regression models by maximum likelihood or instrumental variable procedures. Moreover, 'spsur' implements a collection of Lagrange Multipliers and Likelihood Ratios to test for misspecifications in SUR models.

If you would like, you can install 'spsur' directly from CRAN repository. There you will find also a vignette including some examples, available also in https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spsur/vignettes/spsur-vignette.html

This is the first version of 'spsur'. We want to improve it in the future, therefore, any suggestions or comments related to the package would be very welcome. Your expertise and your feedback would be very important for us.

We hope you find this package interesting for your research and empirical work.

Thanks in advance for your feedback,

Fernando L?pez, Rom?n M?nguez and Jes?s Mur.

Message-ID: <CACsjJ_ceQoXq93LsfriKbav2=-rJnJVWBsoCdRp=fwdhjT_Vzw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear useRs:

It's been some time since we last sent out an announcement, so this one
will cover more than just the last update.

The latest release of randomForestSRC is now available on CRAN at:

https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=randomForestSRC

The GitHub repository, through which we prefer to receive bug reports, is
at:

https://github.com/kogalur/randomForestSRC

If you do find issues, please use:

https://github.com/kogalur/randomForestSRC/issues

and take the time to post a minimal script (and data set if necessary) that
isolates the error.

Additional documentation can be found at:

https://kogalur.github.io/randomForestSRC/

------------------------------------------
Details are as follows:

Ensembles in regression now support Greenwald-Khanna approximate quantile
queries via rfsrc(), predict.rfsrc() and the new wrapper
quantileReg.rfsrc(). Related to this, a new split rule "quantile.regr" has
been added.

Another new wrapper, imbalanced.rfsrc(), implements various solutions to
the two-class imbalanced problem, including the newly proposed
quantile-classifier approach of O'Brien and Ishwaran (2017). This also
includes Breiman's balanced random forests under-sampling of the majority
class.  Performance is assessed using the G-mean, but misclassification
error can be requested.

Also, the new parameter get.tree in predict.rfsrc() allows users to extract
the ensembles for a single tree or subset of trees over the forest.

The default nodesize for survival and competing risk has been changed to 15.

We've added new splitrules "auc" and "entropy" for classification. A new
variable importance methodology called Holdout VIMP has been implemented.
Here, we exclude a variable from a subset of trees and compare the error
rates between those trees in which the variables was included against those
in which it was excluded.  The key point here is that no permutation of a
variable is conducted.  See holdout.vimp.rfsrc() and the associated Rd file
for more information.

Finally, some function names were changed as a general move towards name
uniformity in the package.  Sorry about that.

------------------------------------------
Additional side-notes:

Unfortunately there has been no further work on the Spark build.  However,
the Java wrappers have been kept up to date, and the Hello World script is
still functional.  Instructions are provided here:

https://kogalur.github.io/randomForestSRC/building.html

For those requesting and still awaiting CPU performance enhancements, our
continued apologies.  Our focus has been methodological, but our intention
is to address performance in the next build.  We promise.

Thank you!

Subject: [R-pkgs] rTRNG: Advanced and Parallel Random Number Generation via
 TRNG
Message-ID: <CAHBAGFVJrDQ1yrxjUUbC8UNe_Dh+rFFuwvcH7Q7+Ht7C0Z7dCw@mail.gmail.com>

We are happy to announce the first CRAN release of rTRNG version 4.20-1.

rTRNG is a package for advanced parallel Random Number Generation in
R. It relies on TRNG (Tina?s Random Number Generator,
<https://numbercrunch.de/trng/>), a state-of-the-art C++ pseudo-random
number generator library for sequential and parallel Monte Carlo
simulations. In particular, parallel random number generators provided
by TRNG can be manipulated by jump and split operations. These allow
to jump ahead by an arbitrary number of steps and to split a sequence
into any desired sub-sequence(s), thus enabling techniques suitable to
parallel algorithms, such as block-splitting and leapfrogging.

The package provides the R user with access to the functionality of
the underlying TRNG C++ library. It embeds TRNG sources and headers
and makes them available to other projects combining R with C++.
Beyond this, rTRNG exposes the creation, manipulation and use of
pseudo-random streams to R, via Rcpp and RcppParallel.

Subject: [R-pkgs] WriteXLS version 5.0.0 now available
Message-ID: <63DFFC50-CA0B-48EC-B09A-E11AD86715BD@me.com>

Hi all,

I am pleased to announce that WriteXLS version 5.0.0 is now available on CRAN:

  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WriteXLS/index.html

This supersedes version 4.1.0 and should appear on your local CRAN mirror in due course, if not there already.

WriteXLS, first released in 2009, is a cross-platform, Perl-based R function to create Excel 2003 (XLS) and Excel 2007 (XLSX) files from one or more data frames. 

The primary change in this major new version is improved support for Unicode/UTF-8 variable width character sets, especially on Windows. This is accomplished via the use of writeLines(..., useBytes = TRUE), rather than write.table(), to create intermediate CSV files from the source R data frames. These exported CSV files are then parsed by Perl scripts to create the resultant Excel file.

The prior use of write.table() to create the CSV files could result in the re-encoding of the content of the CSV files into the locale of the computer upon which the code is running. This could result in the loss of the source character encoding used in the originating R data frames, where variable width character sets are in use. This was primarily an issue on Windows, given the limitations of Unicode/UTF-8 support on that OS.

I want to thank Hamid Moshen for first raising this issue in late March, providing test datasets in multiple Unicode/UTF-8 character sets that I could use to reproduce and correct the issues, and his testing of the changes required.

Warm regards,

Marc Schwartz

Subject: [R-pkgs] table.express: use dplyr verbs to build data.table
 expressions
Message-ID: <CAA4naPDVjE=UWYM85dJkywzrYUKYkw=QV_m=e1LZrTx_X=S-GA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I like the expressiveness of dplyr's data manipulation verbs, but I also
appreciate the optimizations offered by data.table, so I figured: why not
both?

The table.express package leverages the rlang package to bridge dplyr and
data.table by essentially parsing and chaining the operations specified by
the verbs,
building expressions that are ultimately evaluated by data.table, letting
it handle optimizations as usual. Some custom verbs are also added to
facilitate building expressions that work on a subset of the data.

The package with single-table verbs is now on CRAN, and the documentation
can also be browsed online at
https://asardaes.github.io/table.express/index.html

Regards,
Alexis.

Message-ID: <CAGkBxuHrAum=1X0PT_za24fdht_UY3R8gKkWsC4VFrB5X7svFA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R community members, please find here a short presentation of our new
package.

We introduce GuessCompx, a new R package that makes an empirical guess on
the time and memory complexities of an algorithm or a function. It will
test multiple, increasing-sizes samples of the user?s data and try to fit
one of seven complexity functions : O(n), O(n2), O(log(n)), etc. Based on a
best fit procedure using LOO-MSE error, it also predicts the full
computation time and memory usage on the whole dataset. It relies on the
base R functions `system.time` and `memory.size `, the latter being only
suitable for Windows users. Together with this result, a plot and a
significance test are also returned.

Complexity is assessed with regard to the user?s actual dataset through its
size (and no other parameter). We provide several examples showing some use
case (distance function, time series, custom function) and how to best tune
the parameters.

The subject of empirical computational complexity has been relatively
little studied in computer sciences, and such a package provides a
convenient and simple procedure to estimate it, thus preventing the user to
run any computation for an unknown amount of time. Empirical fit does not
guarantee to find the true complexity function but approaches it in an
acceptable way. The package does not require to have the code of the target
function.

 tests
Message-ID: <a87f8a21-cd5f-e1b4-1779-23ca4c27e589@ben.edu>

Greetings,

We wanted to announce v. 1.4.0 of the R package 'KScorrect', which 
carries out the Lilliefors correction to the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (K-S) 
test for use in (one-sample) goodness-of-fit tests.

Aside from several minor changes, the biggest change is that the Monte 
Carlo algorithm now supports parallel implementation, using the 
platform-independent 'doParallel' and 'foreach' infrastructure. For 
complex distributions (such as Weibull, gamma, and mixture of normals), 
running in parallel can significantly reduce computation time.

It's well-established that it inappropriate to use the K-S test when 
sample statistics are used to estimate parameters, which results in 
substantially increased Type-II errors. This warning is mentioned in the 
ks.test Help page, but no general solution is currently available for 
non-normal distributions. The 'KScorrect' package corrects for the bias 
by using Monte Carlo simulation, a solution first recommended by 
Lilliefors (1967) but not widely heeded.

Distribution functions are provided in the package for the loguniform 
and univariate mixture of normal distributions, which are not included 
in the R base installation.

Simple examples are provided by calling example(KScorrect) or example(LcKS).

Additional details are available at 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/KScorrect. Bug reports, 
suggestions, and feature requests are encouraged at 
https://github.com/pnovack-gottshall/KScorrect.

We hope you find the functions useful when conducting goodness-of-fit 
tests using the K-S test.

Sincerely,
Phil Novack-Gottshall and Steve Wang

Hello everyone,



Currently, there are more than 14,500 R packages on CRAN providing R with an
unparalleled wealth of features. The downside of the large and increasing
amount of packages is that it becomes increasingly difficult to find the
right tools to tackle a specific problem.



The 'packagefinder' package is designed to search for CRAN packages right
from the R console. The philosophy behind the package is that R users enjoy
working with the R console and need a tool to do their day-to-day-work on
CRAN without leaving their normal workspace, the console.



packagefinder helps you.

* . find the right package for your purpose

* . get detailed information about packages (incl. access to online
documentation)

* . learn about what's new on CRAN

Subject: [R-pkgs] Introducing The New Package 'forestRK'
Message-ID: <69912ad7d1ae41a4b0e1b0f9df1e799b@uwaterloo.ca>

Hello,


I am pleased to announce my new package forestRK. The package implements Forest-RK algorithm discussed in the paper "Forest-RK: A New Random Forest Induction Method" by Simon Bernard, Laurent Heutte, Sebastien Adam, 4th International Conference on Intelligent Computing (ICIC), Sep 2008, Shanghai, China, pp.430-437, to various datasets for classification.


Some of the forestRK functions were built based on the discussion:

  https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/168964/building-a-regression-tree-with-r-from-scratch/168967#168967


Examples of functions included in the new forestRK package are (there are 17 functions in total in this package):


1. construct.treeRK: Builds a single decision tree after implementing the RK (random ?K?) algorithm (i.e. builds ?rktree?);


2. pred.treeRK: Makes predictions on the test observations based on the ?rktree? model in question;


3. draw.treeRK: Makes igraph plot of a ?rktree?.


4. forestRK: Builds a Forest-RK model;


5. pred.forestRK: Makes predictions on the test observations by using the Forest-RK algorithm;



6. mds.plot.forestRK: Generate 2D Multi-Dimensional Scaling plot of the test observations, where the test observations are colour coded by their predicted class type indicated in the pred.forestRK object;


7. importance.forestRK: Calculate Gini Importance of each covariate based on a forestRK model;


8. importance.plot.forestRK: Generate Importance ggplot of the covariates.


The forestRK package also provides tools to encode non-numeric dataset into a numeric one via Numeric Encoding or Binary Encoding.

Message-ID: <CAAGSCf2J4rjmj=DLZAVJLPBtocjN40n31VoO0wv6MQDgQHE57Q@mail.gmail.com>

The *SWIM* (Sensitivity Weights for Importance Weights) package is released
on CRAN: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SWIM.

The *SWIM* package provides weights on simulated scenarios from a
stochastic model, such that stressed model components (random variables)
fulfil given probabilistic constraints (e.g. specified values for risk
measures), under the new scenario weights. Scenario weights are selected by
constrained minimisation of the relative entropy to the baseline model.
Implemented constraints are stresses on the Vaule-at-Risk,
Expected-Shortfall, moments and probability intervals. Visual tools such as
plotting of the stressed empirical distribution function, histograms and
sensitivity measures are provided.

Consult the README for examples on GitHub: https://github.com/spesenti/SWIM

Best regards,
SWIM maintainer

Subject: [R-pkgs] Introducing teamr Package
Message-ID: <CAJnynRN1hTgmrAO=EDOixktCQee122JPtqEMRc6FEYXhn5vNZw@mail.gmail.com>

Today I am so pleased to introduce my first CRAN package for sending
formatted messages to Microsoft Teams, teamr
<https://github.com/wwwjk366/teamr>.

Motivation is simple here. For years I have been using Slack and built many
slash commands and apps using incoming webhooks with R, but ever since I
started to use Teams, I found that we will have the same needs for
communicating with R as well. So with some inspiration from the Python
package pymsteams <https://pypi.org/project/pymsteams/>. I created
teamr package
with the hope that this package will provide a simple and clean way to talk
to Teams from R.
Installation

You can install the released version of teamr from CRAN
<https://cran.r-project.org/> with:

install.packages("teamr")

And the development version from GitHub <https://github.com/> with:

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wwwjk366/teamr")

Example

This is a basic example of send a simple titled message to MS Teams:

library(teamr)
# initiate new connector card object
cc <- connector_card$new(hookurl =
"https://outlook.office.com/webhook/...")# add text
cc$text("This is text of main body.")# add title
cc$title("This is message title")# add hyperlink button
cc$add_link_button("Read more", "https://www.google.com")# change theme color
cc$color("#008000")

We can print out the payload that will be sending to given webhook using
printmethod

# print out the payload for checking
cc$print()

Card:
  hookurl: https://outlook.office.com/webhook/...
  payload:  {"text":"This is text of main body.","title":"This is
message title","potentialAction":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"ViewAction","name":"Read
more","target":["https://www.google.com"]}],"themeColor":"#008000"}

Our JSON payload looks good, time to send it out :)

# send to Teams
cc$send()

[1] TRUE

send menthod will return TRUE if send was successful (status code 200). If
it failed, it will return the reponse object for further investigation. Our
message with a link button will looks like this:

Subject: [R-pkgs] ceramic - download web map tiles to local cache
Message-ID: <CAAcGz9_jHUaJE9gdRexnzkCfAkuwUpddmWmVPug9ZnaXD1TadQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

There's a new package ceramic to download online imagery tiles.

Download imagery tiles to a local cache and load the data into raster
objects. Facilities  are provided for Amazon 'AWS' terrain
https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/terrain/ and Mapbox images and
terrain https://www.mapbox.com/.

Use of Mapbox requires obtaining an API key and setting it locally,
functions that require this key provide information on doing this if a
valid key is not found.

Tiled imagery may be downloaded and cached by providing a spatial extent in
several possible formats, with optional control over provider, tile type,
format and zoom.  Direct access to load a raster image will trigger the
tile download and caching, if required.

The release 0.6.0 of ceramic is available on CRAN:

https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ceramic

The development repository of ceramic is hosted on GitHub:

https://github.com/hypertidy/ceramic

Thank you.

Message-ID: <CAKcJ18NYWQOmCZD+ks0bh7j9FHeTto0qgFfh5J=GSsFCfQ-6FA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would like to introduce you to a new package available on CRAN for
performing meta-analysis of dose-response relationships, 'MBNMAdose'.

For anyone who has performed a meta-analysis or network meta-analysis
before, you might be aware of the difficulties of including different doses
of a drug. Typically one either assumes that different doses have a broadly
similar effect, or that they are totally independent.

MBNMAdose allows you to explicitly model the dose-response relationship in
a statistically robust framework. By modelling dose-response relationships
this can connect networks of evidence that might otherwise be disconnected,
and can improve precision on treatment estimates.

There's a detailed vignette included with the package that explains
everything in a lot more detail for those that are interested.

Any feedback or suggestions for improvements would be hugely welcome.

Many thanks,

Hugo

Message-ID: <63dd5294-e9ae-294d-5f09-0a835c40637d@sicyon.com>

The new version (2.0.0) of 'spectrino' package is released on CRAN: 
_https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spectrino_.

Remainder: ?spectrino? is a spectra preparation software utility for R. 
It is OS specific tool (Microsoft Windows), with specialized 
visualization, organization and pre-processing features for spectra 
(mostly mass-spec). The software accepts spectral data from analytical 
instruments and then prepares a data structure to be introduced into R. 
?spectrino? has a rich set of features to create data structures and 
visually manipulate/compare spectra.

Version 2.0 of Spectrino adds new features to the spectral part of the 
application (multi-tab spec-trees) and a completely new part - blocks of 
properties. The latter provides user interface to a list of properties 
(accessible from your script) as well as log, chart and snippet (small 
pieces of code) support. As properties are modifiable from both sides: 
user interface and your code, this feature offers a versatile and 
convenient way for parametrized control to your algorithm.

For more details (including manual) visit http://spectrino.com

You may read an article about Spectrino (v1.6) in "Journal of 
Statistical Software" https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v018i10

Message-ID: <DM6PR12MB3452B8D51C55AF591A01335C9F820@DM6PR12MB3452.namprd12.prod.outlook.com>

Hello R users,

I am excited to introduce a new package for R which is now available on CRAN called ?backbone?.
The package can be found here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/backbone/index.html

The backbone package provides methods for extracting from a weighted graph a binary or signed backbone that retains only the significant edges. The user may input a weighted graph, or a bipartite graph from which a weighted graph is first constructed via projection.

Backbone extraction methods include:
the stochastic degree sequence model (Neal, Z. P. (2014). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.06.001),
hypergeometric model (Neal, Z. (2013). https://doi.org/10.1007/s13278-013-0107-y),
the fixed degree sequence model (Zweig, K. A., and Kaufmann, M. (2011). https://doi.org/10.1007/s13278-011-0021-0),
as well as a universal threshold method.

A vignette which describes the package in greater detail can be found here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/backbone/vignettes/backbone_introduction.html

The package will be constantly updated with new functions and methods.
If you have any backbone extraction methods you would like to see included, please contact the package maintainer Rachel Domagalski at <domagal9 at msu.edu>.

Very best regards,

DeaR users,

A new package called 'funprog' is now on CRAN : https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=funprog

'funprog' contains high-order functions to manipulate data, given one or more auxiliary functions.
Functions are inspired by other pure functional programming languages (Haskell mainly).

The package also provides built-in function operators for creating compact anonymous functions, as well as the possibility to use the purrr package syntax.

If you are interested, you will find more details and examples here : https://gitlab.com/py_b/funprog#readme

Best regards,

Message-ID: <CAGzH7UfN-qWE1N0=Mm1i-uVCEc24_dyL0qi70UMkjcHxFTGt=A@mail.gmail.com>

Version 3.x of the survival package is now available from CRAN.  This is a
major update whose primary goal is to make the analysis of multi-state
survival models as easy to do as simple Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional
hazard fits. The primary changes are

    -- in Surv(time1, time2, status) the status variable can now be a
factor that specifies which state a subject has transitioned into.  From a
user's point of view this is the single key change.

    -- survfit() will then create multi-state Pr(state | time) curves,
i.e., the Aalen-Johansen estimate.  (Kaplan-Meier and cumulative incidence
are special cases of the AJ).  Printout and plotting are unchanged.

    -- coxph() will then create multi-state fits.  There is an easy
formula-like syntax for specifying shared coefficients or baseline hazards.

    -- all use standard data, i.e. the (time1, time2, status) format that
is common for time-dependent covariates; there is no need to create special
intermediate data sets.  (An id variable is necessary to specify which rows
go with whom.)

    -- robust variance estimates available throughout

Many other CRAN packages depend on survival, which drove a second goal of
"don't break it".  Part of the testing involved running the test suits of
all 679 reverse dependencies under the new version.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package 'semEff'
Message-ID: <CAJ+Uk2V_9fZD+bJ+s5DG3Yto0tPLCO-fD_qLS7Vb60m+HGX7Sg@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi,

I have a new package <https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/semEff>
available for automatic effect calculation for 'piecewise' structural
equation models (SEM), commonly used in ecology and evolution. Confidence
intervals are provided via bootstrapping. It also does some useful things
for linear and generalised linear (mixed) models, like standardised
coefficients, R-squared, etc. Feedback/bug reports welcome. This is my
first CRAN release.

Cheers,
Mark

Subject: [R-pkgs] ropenblas package
Message-ID: <CAKwavrn3m5nt-Y_LGiL-M=afdS-Ty=HEOAQtNg+QDsqVurq_4A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

The *ropenblas* <https://prdm0.github.io/ropenblas/> is a package designed
to facilitate the linking of the library *OpenBLAS*
<https://www.openblas.net/> with the language *R*
<https://www.r-project.org/>. The package, which works only for Linux
systems, will automatically download the latest source code from the
*OpenBLAS* <https://www.openblas.net/> library and compile the code. The
package will automatically bind the language *R*
<https://www.r-project.org/> to use the *OpenBLAS*
<https://www.openblas.net/> library. Everything will be done automatically
regardless of the Linux distribution you are using.

You can also specify older versions of the *OpenBLAS*
<https://www.openblas.net/> library. Automatically, if no version is
specified, the *ropenblas* <https://prdm0.github.io/ropenblas/> package
will consider the latest version of the library *OpenBLAS*
<https://www.openblas.net/>.

Considering using the *OpenBLAS* <https://www.openblas.net/> library rather
than the *BLAS* <http://www.netlib.org/blas/> may bring extra optimizations
for your code and improved computational performance for your simulations,
since *OpenBLAS* <https://www.openblas.net/> is an optimized implementation
of the library *BLAS* <http://www.netlib.org/blas/>.

Some of the reasons why it is convenient to link *R*
<https://www.r-project.org/> language to the use of *BLAS*
<http://www.netlib.org/blas/> optimized alternatives can be found *here*
<https://csantill.github.io/RPerformanceWBLAS/>. Several other *benchmarks*
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking> that point to improved
computing performance by considering the library *OpenBLAS*
<https://www.openblas.net/> can be found on the internet.

Best regards,

Pedro Rafael.

Subject: [R-pkgs] concurve v 2.3.0 - Comparing Functions, Bootstrapping,
 and Exporting Tables
Message-ID: <CAD3yMvKA7k7tHBc9v4KCyR_Wmd3sBYMB+=RhnJvCyY=j-p0aGA@mail.gmail.com>

Pleased to announce that the next version (2.3.0) of our package ?concurve?
is out on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=concurve).

In addition to plotting confidence (consonance) curves, it can now plot two
functions next to one another to see the amount of overlap. It can also
plot likelihood and deviance functions along with consonance densities and
distributions.

And it can utilize bootstrapping (the BCa and t method) to approximate the
curves, distributions, and densities. And to top it off, it can export
tables of relevant statistics in various formats.

We welcome any feedback and bug reports (
https://github.com/zadchow/concurve/issues)

Best,

Zad R. Chow

Subject: [R-pkgs] christmas package
Message-ID: <CACr7k5J5brk29wofrWYyKqqqNphbCLL5QLKScOrkAmx0Lj+aUg@mail.gmail.com>

Generation of a number of Christmas cards, most of them being animated. The
name of each card includes the year in which it was created.

Some examples are:

- The christmas card that was writen in 2009 shows a ?caganer? (
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caganer):

> library(christmas)
> xmas2009caganer()

- The 2019 design is about CRM (Christmas regression model)  ;-)

> xmas2019regression()

Have a nice 2020!
