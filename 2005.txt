Subject: [R-pkgs] New package: MatchIt
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0501111309520.4433@stat.harvard.edu>

We would like to announce the release of our software MatchIt, now 
available on CRAN.   MatchIt implements a variety of matching methods for 
causal inference.  

Abstract:
MatchIt implements the suggestions of Ho, Imai, King, and Stuart (2004) 
for improving parametric statistical models by preprocessing data with 
nonparametric matching methods. MatchIt implements a wide range of 
sophisticated matching methods, making it possible to greatly reduce the 
dependence of causal inferences on hard-to-justify, but commonly made, 
statistical modeling assumptions. The software also easily fits into 
existing research practices since, after preprocessing data with MatchIt, 
researchers can use whatever parametric model they would have used without 
MatchIt, but produce inferences with substantially more robustness and 
less sensitivity to modeling assumptions. MatchIt is an R program, and 
also works seamlessly with Zelig.

For more information, please see http://gking.harvard.edu/matchit/.  
Comments and suggestions are welcome.  

Sincerely,
Daniel Ho, Kosuke Imai, Gary King, and Elizabeth Stuart

Dear all,

I have just uploaded to CRAN the version 1.2 of the package
'adehabitat'. This package now contains new functions for
the estimation of home ranges (Nearest neighbour convex
hull, brownian bridge approach for kernel estimation),
estimation of schoener's ratio.  This package now allows a
better management of objects of class "area" (see plot.area,
perarea, ararea). Some arguments of the graphical functions
have also been changed (kernel, image.kasc, scatter.enfa).
Finally, some minor bugs have been corrected. Note that
the package now need that the packages ade4 and gpclib
are installed.

Questions, comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Happy testing,


Cl?ment Calenge.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package for microeconomics: micEcon
Message-ID: <200502211256.45195.ahenningsen@email.uni-kiel.de>

Dear all,

I have uploaded a new package called micEcon (version 0.1-3) to CRAN 
(an early version of this package has been already presented at useR! 2004).
It contains tools for microeconomic analysis and microeconomic modeling.
These are for instance:

- tools for demand analysis with the 'Almost Ideal Demand System' (AIDS): 
e.g. econometric estimation, calculation of price and income/expenditure 
elasticities, checking for theoretical consistency

- tools for production/firm analysis with the 'Symmetric Normalized 
Quadratic' (SNQ) profit function: e.g. econometric estimation, calculation of 
price elasticities and shadow prices, imposing convexity

- tools for quadratic and translog functions, e.g. econometric estimation, 
calculation of Hessians and derivatives

- functions to write input files for and read output files of Tim Coelli's 
(1996) program "Frontier 4.1" (http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/cepa/ 
software.htm). In this way R can use "Frontier 4.1" to perform stochastic 
frontier analysis.

- a function to perform a two-step Heckman ("heckit") estimation to correct 
for non-random sample selection

- functions to calculate "Laspeyres", "Paasche" or "Fisher" price and quantity 
indices


I have checked most of the functions by comparing their results with values 
published in the literature or obtained by other software. However, I cannot 
guarantee that they return correct results in all possible cases. So please 
check these functions (results, code) and send me bug reports or patches.
You are also invited to provide further functions, e.g. tools for other 
functional forms.

Best regards,
Arne

Message-ID: <200502281503.50641.tobias.sing@mpi-sb.mpg.de>

Dear R users,

we are glad to announce the release of our new R package ROCR, for visualizing 
the performance of scoring classifiers (available on CRAN). We hope that the 
package might be useful for those of you working on classification problems. 
For details, see the package description below, or the ROCR website: 
http://rocr.bioinf.mpi-sb.mpg.de. You can get a short overview by typing 
'demo(ROCR)'. Any kind of feedback (questions, comments, suggestions, bug 
reports) is very welcome.

Best regards,
  the ROCRs (Tobias Sing, Oliver Sander, Niko Beerenwinkel, Thomas Lengauer)

Package description:
-------------------------
ROC graphs, sensitivity/specificity curves, lift charts, and precision/recall 
plots are popular examples of trade-off visualizations for specific pairs of 
performance measures. ROCR is a flexible tool for creating 
cutoff-parametrized 2D performance curves by freely combining two from over 
25 performance measures (new performance measures can be added using a 
standard interface). Curves from different cross-validation or bootstrapping 
runs can be averaged by different methods, and standard deviations, standard 
errors or box plots can be used to visualize the variability across the runs. 
The parametrization can be visualized by printing cutoff values at the 
corresponding curve positions, or by coloring the curve according to cutoff. 
All components of a performance plot can be quickly adjusted using a flexible 
parameter dispatching mechanism. Despite its flexibility, ROCR is easy to 
use, with only three commands and reasonable default values for all optional 
parameters.

New on CRAN: phpSerialize Version 0.8
Dieter Menne, dieter.menne at menne-biomed.de

Serializes R objects for PHP import into an associative array. 
Main use is for building web pages with R-support. 

Has mainly been tested with lm,lme, nlme and their summaries.

A web example is provide, showing

-- How to start R from php/Apache
-- How to pass variables from php to R via Environment
-- How to create serialized php output from R
-- How to read the serialize output from php/Apache via pipe
-- How to display individual results in a table
-- How to display the structure of the associative array.

For example, the following R structure...

  Delta=as.numeric(Sys.getenv("DELTA")) # Get Info from php
  wc = wilcox.test(rnorm(10),rnorm(10)+Delta)

... is is piped to standard output
  cat(phpSerialize(wc),"\n")

... and after deserialization

  $pp = popen("$Rterm --no-save  --slave  2>&1 < $RFile DELTA=$Delta","r");
  // Read serialized R output via pipe.
  $sWilcox=fgets($pp);
  pclose($pp);
  $Wilcox=unserialize($sWilcox);
  print_r($Wilcox);

... prints as follows:

Array
(
  [statistic] => Array
  (
    [W] => 29
  )

  [parameter] => 
  [p.value] => 0.1230055

Message-ID: <207fa1db08ad58cc37bcf4eceb887741@soc.soton.ac.uk>

Announcing the release of a new R package ResistorArray.


This package solves the (nontrivial) general problem of resistance on 
arbitrary (finite)
resistor arrays.

Outside electrical engineering, the problem has a wide range of 
applications to
situations such as groundwater modelling; there is a direct 
correspondence
between electrical networks and random walks.

The package has a reasonably complete set of literature references, and 
solves a number
of classical problems such as the resistance between opposite points of 
a skeleton resistor
cube, and the Wheatstone bridge.

The package comes with a variety of standard resistor arrays, including 
all five platonic
solids, the Fibonacci ladder, and "N" arbitrary resistors in series.

The package gives nice numerical illustrations of a few theoretical 
results from the
recent (2004) literature.

One of the Google aptitude tests was to determine the electrical 
resistance between two points
on an infinite grid of resistors. I couldn't solve this problem 
analytically (although I found the
other day that a solution does exist);  ResistorArray gets the answer 
correct to within about 1%.

Subject: [R-pkgs] msm version 0.5 released
Message-ID: <422ED490.8040307@imperial.ac.uk>

A major update of the "msm" package for continuous-time Markov and
hidden Markov multi-state models is now available from CRAN.

Hidden Markov models with general, continuous response distributions are
now supported.  These models are used for Markov processes which can
only be observed through the value of some noisy marker.

Censored states are now supported at any observation time.  The
observation scheme is also allowed to be different for each observation,
for example, process snapshot / fully-observed histories /
partially-observed histories such as death times.

Users upgrading from previous versions of msm should note that
some of the syntax for specifying models has changed.  In particular,
initial values are now specified in the "qmatrix" and "covinits"
arguments instead of the inits argument, so that "qmatrix" is no longer
a matrix of 0/1 indicators.

As always, refer to the user guide "msm-manual.pdf" in the "doc"
subdirectory for a full description of the methodology, and worked
examples in the use of the package.  See the appendix for a full
list of the syntax changes, and the NEWS file in the top-level
installation directory for a full list of the changes in this release.

Subject: [R-pkgs] mgcv 1.2-0
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0503111253460.28840@moon.stats.gla.ac.uk>

mgcv version 1.2 is on CRAN now. mgcv provides generalized additive models 
and generalized additive mixed models with automatic estimation of the 
smoothness of model components. 

Changes in this version are:

* A new gam fitting method is implemented for the generalized case. It 
provides more reliable convergence than the previous default, but can be 
a little slower.  See ?gam.method, ?gam.fit2 and ?gam.outer for details. 
The old method is still available as an option.

* `gam' has acquired a new list argument `method' to cope with the number 
of fitting  method options now available, and there has been some alteration 
to the `control' argument.

* Any smoothers can now be used to construct nested models, including 
tensor product smooths. See ?fixDependence and ?gam.side for details.

* By default all smooths are now parameterized to be centred, without 
requiring additional constraints (this is automatic and applies also to 
user defined smooths). The old behaviour is still available as an option. 
See ?smoothCon for details. (This should be user transparent.) 

* Smoothing parameter initialization has been modified for better 
performance with tensor product smooths. See ?initial.sp.

* By default, tensor product smooths have been modified to use more 
interpretable penalties. See ?te for details. This leaves smooths based 
on the default basis unchanged, but improves the performance of smooths 
based on other marginal bases.

* Examples of how to obtain variance estimates etc. efficiently, for any 
quantities derived from a fitted gam model are provided in ?predict.gam.

Dear R-users,

I'd like to announce the release of my new package "ltm" (available 
from CRAN), for fitting Latent Trait Models (including the Rasch 
model) under the Item Response Theory approach. The latent trait model 
is the analogous of the factor analysis model for Bernoulli response 
data. "ltm" fits the linear one- and two-factor models but also allows 
for inclusion of nonlinear latent terms (e.g., interaction and 
quadratic). Any kind of feedback (questions, suggestions, bug-reports, 
etc.) is more than welcome.

Best,
Dimitris

We would like to announce the availability on CRAN of a new version (1.5)
of our package "distr" .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from 1.4 to 1.5

-package is now using /lazy loading/ 
-minor changes in the help pages
-minor enhancements in plot for distributions 
 (Gamma, discrete distributions)
-package now includes a demo - folder; try /demo("distr")/
-class /Gamma/ has been renamed /Gammad/ to avoid name collisions
-we have a CITATION file now; consider /citation("distr")/
-enhanced demos:
  +convolution of uniform variables now includes exact expressions
  +min/max of two variables now available for discrete distributions
-rd-Files have now a keyword entry for distribution and thus may be
 found by the search engine
-exact formula for  "Unif" o "numeric" where o \in { +,-,*,/ }

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Description of "distr":
"distr" is to provide a conceptual treatment of random variables
(r.v.'s) by means of S4--classes. A virtual mother class "Distribution" 
is introduced.
All distributions of the "base" package are implemented as subclasses of
either "AbscontDistribution" or "DiscreteDistribution".

Using these classes, we also provide (default) methods to automatically
generate the image distributions under unary mathematical operations as
well as a general convolution algorithm.

Additionally, we also provide classes for a standardized treatment of
simulations (also under contaminations) and evaluations of statistical
procedures on such simulations.

Subject: [R-pkgs] perturb package for evaluating collinearity
Message-ID: <20050331221639.5642.qmail@web52703.mail.yahoo.com>

I've uploaded the R package "perturb" to CRAN. Perturb contains two
programs for evaluating collinearity. "Colldiag" calculates condition
indexes and variance decomposition proportions to detect and track
down collinear sets of variables. 

"Perturb" takes a different approach. It re-estimates the model a
specified number of times, adding random noise ("perturbations") to
selected variables at each iteration. Categorical variables are
randomly reclassified. A summary then displays the impact of these
perturbations on the stability of the coefficients. Perturb is not
limited to linear regression and can handle interaction effects and
transformations of independent variables.

Version 1 of perturb was available from my website. This new version
makes it much easier to reclassify categorical variables. In
addition, colldiag now has a "fuzz" option to suppress printing of
small variance decomposition values.

Comments and criticisms invited,
John Hendrickx

Subject: [R-pkgs] Version 0.95-1 of the lme4 package
Message-ID: <424D90A4.3060600@stat.wisc.edu>

This may sound like an April Fool's joke but it isn't really.

I just uploaded version 0.95-1 of the lme4 package for R.  This is the 
package with the new versions of the lme (linear mixed-effects) function 
for R and the GLMM (generalized linear mixed models) function.

One distinguishing feature of the 0.95 series of releases of this 
package is the absence of the lme and GLMM functions.  They have been 
replaced by a single function called lmer (pronounced "Elmer").  The 
name could stand for "lme revised" or for "lme for R".

The method of specifying models for lmer is slightly different from that 
for lme, which is the reason for using a new name for this function.  In 
lmer the random effects terms and their grouping factors are specified 
in the formula.  Furthermore, if a family argument is given then a 
generalized linear mixed model is fit - otherwise a linear mixed model 
is fit.

I am writing an article for the next edition of R News describing the 
changes from lme to lmer.  In the meantime you can look at the examples 
and the tests directory of the mlmRev package to see examples of 
specifying lmer models.

My apologies for springing this on the community without warning.  I had 
planned to do a bit more development and create more documentation 
before releasing this new version but yesterday I accidently triggered a 
cascade of inconsistencies by uploading a new version of the Matrix package.

If you are using the current lme4 and prefer not to make changes at this 
time then stay with the 0.9 series of releases and don't update to 0.95-1.

Message-ID: <20050412185548.56646.qmail@web52701.mail.yahoo.com>

I've uploaded a new version of "catspec" to CRAN. Catspec is for
estimating certain "special categorical" models. It also contains
"ctab", a function for creating one-way, two-way, and multi-way
percentage tables (nothing special there really). Ctab can now print
more than one percentage type, as well as table marginals.

The first special model in catspec is "mclgen". Mclgen restructures a
data frame so a multinomial logistic model can be estimated using a
condition logit program. Doing so provides much more flexibility for
imposing restrictions on the response variable.

The second special (set of) models is "sqtab", for estimating
loglinear models for square tables (aka "mobility models") such as
symmetry, quasi-independence. One application can be to specify such
models as multinomial logistic models with covariates, using mclgen.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Version 1.0-0 of the Rcmdr package
Message-ID: <20050416162729.SGNL25800.tomts13-srv.bellnexxia.net@JohnDesktop8300>

Dear list members,

I've just uploaded version 1.0-0 of the Rcmdr package to CRAN. For people
who haven't seen the package before, the "R Commander" provides a
basic-statistics graphical user interface to R, based on the tcltk package.
The new version incorporates a number of improvements to the R Commander
interface, as documented in the CHANGES file distributed with the package,
and I feel that the package is now sufficiently polished and stable to
warrant finally bumping the version number to 1.0-0.

More details are available at
<http://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/index.html> and in the
manual distributed with the package and accessible through the R Commander
"Help -> Introduction to the R Commander" menu.

As usual, comments, suggestions, etc., are appreciated.

John

Message-ID: <42637BC3.3060601@statistik.uni-dortmund.de>

Dear useRs,

RWinEdt_1.7-0 has been released.

Windows users of R-2.1.0 (which is scheduled to be released today) who 
are going to use a translated (i.e. non-english) version of RGui 
together with WinEdt will have to upgrade.

It is not advisable to upgrade RWinEdt for R versions < 2.1.0.

RWinEdt can be used in form of an R package (e.g. by saying 
install.packages("RWinEdt") within R-2.1.0) and as a manually 
installable WinEdt Plug-In.

Subject: [R-pkgs] Biodem 0.1/orphaning of MAlmig
Message-ID: <1114352087.14892.669.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Together with Alessio Boattini of the University of Bologna we have
created a package called Biodem. Biodem provides a number of functions
for Biodemographycal analysis, and we hope it will be useful to the
anthropological community.

Because Biodem contains all the functions found in Malmig (a package I
maintain), I would like to orphan it, or, even better, have it removed
from CRAN.

Finally, Biodem has been build on a Debian Linux box and is therefore
not yet available for Windows/OS X; Biodem was built with R 2.0.1
because I am using Debian 'testing' and the new R 2.1.0 is not yet
available for 'testing'. I will upload Biodem 0.2 as soon as I can build
it with R 2.1.

Regards,

Federico Calboli

Subject: [R-pkgs] GPArotation  package
Message-ID: <426FEE94.502@bank-banque-canada.ca>

We have just put a package GPArotation on CRAN. The functions in this 
package perform an number of different orthogonal and oblique rotations 
for factor analysis, using the gradient projection algorithm described 
in Coen A. Bernaards and Robert I. Jennrich  (2005),  "Gradient 
Projection Algorithms and Software for Arbitrary Rotation Criteria in 
Factor Analysis, ", Educational and Psychological Measurement (in 
press).  Additional details are available on the web site  
<http://www.stat.ucla.edu/research/gpa>.

The following rotations are available:

oblimin     oblique       oblimin family       
quartimin   oblique                    
targetT     orthogonal    target rotation

infomaxQ    oblique                      
mccammon    orthogonal    McCammon minimum entropy ratio

Other rotations can be fairly easily added simply by coding a small 
function to calculate the rotation criterion objective function, and 
its gradient. A detailed example of gradient computation is in the
paper mentioned above.

Subject: [R-pkgs] update: zoo 0.9-9
Message-ID: <20050428125820.2d776c5d.Achim.Zeileis@R-project.org>

Dear useRs,

a new version of the zoo package for totally ordered observations is
available from CRAN. It contains many new features, the most important
of which are: support of regular time series, an improved merge method
and functions for carrying out rolling analyses of time series. A more
detailed list of changes and new features is given below.

All features (both old and new) are also documented in the package
vignette.

Best wishes,
Z


Changes in Version 0.9-9

  o regular "zoo" series: objects of class "zooreg" (inheriting from
    "zoo") can be used to store strictly regular series (similar to "ts"
    objects) or series with an underlying regularity (as before but with
    observations omitted). They have a frequency attribute that can be
    used for conversion between "zoo" and "ts". The function
    is.regular() can be used for checking the regularity of a series.

  o improved merge() method: merge.zoo now accepts non-zoo arguments
    (other than first) if all non-zoo args have the same NROW value
    as the first argument (or are scalar). In that case the non-zoo
    args are given the index of the first series. Scalars are added
    for the full index of the merged series.

  o merge() zoo can now optionally return a "data.frame" that contains
    the numeric columns as "zoo" series and the "zoo" objects created
    from factors converted back to "factor".
    
  o [.zoo allows now indexing using observations from the index scale
    (and not only observation numbers).

  o rapply, rollmean, rollmax, rollmedian to perform rolling analyses

  o extended functionality to plot.zoo type argument

  o when plot.zoo used with one series list(...) can be omitted from 
    various plotting parameter arguments

  o print.zoo documentation fix for R 2.1.0

  o yearmon and yearqtr datetime classes

  o head.ts, tail.ts

  o c.zoo, range.zoo

  o coredata.default, coredata.ts

Subject: [R-pkgs] new package: dynlm 0.1-0
Message-ID: <20050428125843.7ce8f7a8.Achim.Zeileis@R-project.org>

Dear useRs,

recently, there were several discussions on R-help about how to
conveniently fit dynamic linear models and time series regressions. The
package dynlm tries to address this problem by 1. providing some more
functions like lags L() and differences d() and season() in the formula
specification of a model and 2. preserving the time series attributes of
the data. 

A first version of the dynlm package (which depends on the newest zoo
version) is now available from CRAN. For more information look at the
man pages and examples in the package.

Feedback is more than welcome.

Best wishes,
Z

Message-ID: <20050428125849.0df802e4.Achim.Zeileis@R-project.org>

Dear useRs,

a new version of the lmtest package is available from CRAN. Thanks to
Giovanni Millo who provided the initial versions of several new
functions (and many helpful discussions), there is new functionality for
the comparison of nested and non-nested linear models.

For non-nested model comparisons, the Cox test, encompassing test and 
J test are now available.

For nested model comparisons, there is the function waldtest() which
allows convenient specification of the models and into which H(A)C
estimates can be plugged. Thus, waldtest() can be seen as the
`econometric' counterpart to the anova() method, just as coeftest() can
be seen as the `econometric' counterpart of summary() for "lm" objects.

Best wishes,
Z

Message-ID: <427608FE.3080201@R-project.org>

Dear RWinEdt users,

unfortunately, it seems to be impossible to support localized (i.e. 
translated) versions of RGui in MDI mode. The support of this feature 
has been removed now. All the workarounds I tried caused bugs (as many 
of you told me re. RWinEdt_1.7-0). Thanks for all the bug reports!

It is recommended to use the new version of RWinEdt (1.7-1) together 
with RGui in SDI mode (which should work with arbitrary translations).
Further on, only english versions of RGui in MDI mode are supported by 
RWinEdt.

Message-ID: <42830A0F.2010206@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr>

Dear all,

I have just uploaded to CRAN the version 1.3 of the
package 'adehabitat'. Significant changes are
listed below:

- Several functions allowing the conversion from
  and to classes of the package sp have been added.
  Maps of class "asc", "kasc", "area", as well as
  radio-monitoring of class "traj" can now be
  converted to the spatial classes available in sp.

- The function buffer.line() allows to compute buffer
  around a line

- The function distfacmap() converts one factor map
  into a set of maps giving the distance to the
  patches belonging to the different levels.

- The kernel home-range estimation can now be fitted
  using an Epanechnikov kernel (though it is still
  optional), resulting in a quicker estimation.

- The former function enfa() has been modified. It
  now requires a data frame (available units) and
  a vector (use of each unit). If the data consist
  of a point pattern and of an object kasc, the
  function data2enfa is to be used before.

- The function angles() now takes an argument
  indicating how successive relocations
  located at the same place have to be managed.

- The function as.traj now requires at least 2
  relocations to return a trajectory

- That's all, thanks for reading !

Questions, comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.
Happy testing,

Message-ID: <4D99275E380CA94F998977EDACE548DC06265F@extas2-hba.tas.csiro.au>

There is a new version of the 'mvbutils' package (v1.1.1) available on
CRAN.

For existing users, the main new features are:

(i) 'help' now works properly with with R2.0+ (!)
(ii) 'mvbutils' is now NAMESPACEd, so you can avoid naming conflicts
with other packages. (Many functions are no longer user-visible.
(iii) Lazy-loading of individual objects is now available. Among other
things, this speeds up the use of 'cd' immensely with workspaces that
contain large objects.
(iv) better-organized interactions between 'history' and 'cd'.

For new users, the main features of 'mvbutils' are:

  * Hierarchical organization of projects and sub-projects, allowing
switching within a single R session, searching and moving objects
through the hierarchy, objects in ancestor projects always visible from
child (sub)projects, etc.

  * Improved function editing facilities, interfacing with whichever
text editor you prefer. The R command line is not frozen while editing,
and you can have multiple edit windows open. There is also a complete
automatic backup system, with (as a side-effect) the ability to sort
objects by date.

  * "Lazy loading" for individual objects, allowing fast & efficient
access to collections of biggish objects where only a few objects are
used at a time.

  * Support for flat-format (plain-text) documentation, stored along
with a function and editable at the same time, and viewable through
normal 'help'. Automatic conversion to Rd format is available if certain
rules are followed.

  * Support for nesting of 'source' calls, and for interspersing R code
and data in the same file.

  * Support for easy macro-like functions which act in their caller's
environment (see also RNews 1/3), and for "dynamically scoped"
functions.

  * Graphical display of which functions call which other functions.

  * numerous other lower-level utility functions and operators.

Please let me know of any comments and bug reports.

Version 1.0-3 of the pls package is now available on CRAN.

The pls package implements partial least squares regression (PLSR) and
principal component regression (PCR).  Features of the package include

- Several plsr algorithms: orthogonal scores, kernel pls and simpls
- Flexible cross-validation
- A formula interface, with traditional methods like predict, coef,
  plot and summary
- Functions for extraction of scores and loadings, and calculation of
  (R)MSEP and R2
- A simple multiplicative scatter correction (msc) implementation
- Functions for plotting predictions, validation statistics,
  coefficients, scores, loadings and biplots.

(The pls package is meant to supersede the pls.pcr package.)

Conditional Inference Procedures in a Permutation Test Framework

The `coin' package implements a general framework for conditional
inference procedures, commonly known as permutation tests,
theoretically derived by Strasser & Weber (1999). The conditional
expectation and covariance for a broad class of multivariate linear
statistics as well as the corresponding multivariate limiting distribution
was derived by Strasser & Weber (1999). These results are
utilized to construct tests for independence between two sets of
variables.

Beside a general implementation of the abstract framework the package
offers a rather huge set of convenience functions implementing well
known classical as well as less prominent classical and non-classical test
procedures in a conditional inference framework. Examples are linear rank
statistics for the two- and K-sample location and scale problem against
ordered and unordered alternatives including post-hoc tests for arbitrary
contrasts, tests of independence for contingency tables, two- and K-sample
tests for censored data, tests for independence of two continuous
variables as well as tests for marginal homogeneity and symmetry.
Conditional counterparts of most of the classical procedures given in
famous text books like Hollander & Wolfe (1999) or Agresti (2002) can be
implemented as part of the general framework without much effort.
Approximations of the exact null distribution via the limiting
distribution and conditional Monte-Carlo procedures are available for
every test while the exact null distribution
is currently available for two-sample problems only.

Inference problems can be specified by a traditional formula based
interface. Support for data available as `exprSet' objects in a BioC
environment is implemented as well. The theoretical framework is sketched
in the vignette and we refer to `vignette("coin")' for further details.

Comments, suggestions, bug-reports etc. are more than welcome!

Best,

Subject: [R-pkgs] New CRAN package dyn
Message-ID: <971536df050608100869f5196d@mail.gmail.com>

dyn is an R package that facilitates the use of regression
using time series data with lags and diffs (known as dynamic
regression).  It is a lightweight package that has no
facilities of its own but leverages off the various time
series and regression functions in R to make it easier to
use them together.

Its features include:

- many regression functions.  It can be used with lm, glm,
  loess, rq, randomForest, lqs, rlm and any other regression 
  functions that use model.frame and are written in the
  style of lm.

- many time series classes. It can be used with ts, zooreg,
  zoo, its, and irts time series classes.  This covers
  regular, weakly regular and irregular time series classes.

- missing values.  Time series may have missing values including
  internal missing values.  Both na.omit and na.exclude are
  supported.  

- good citizen.  It does not replace the regression
  functions but rather works with them by providing new
  methods to the standard R generics: model.frame, resid,
  fitted, predict, update, anova and $.

- ease of use.  dyn enables one to use the same regression
  functions (lm, glm, etc.) using the same syntax one has
  always used.  Just preface the regression function name with 
  dyn$ and it is transformed into a regression function that 
  can handle time series:

   dyn$lm( y ~ x + lag(x) + diff(w) )     # lm
   dyn$loess( y ~ x + lag(x) + diff(w) )  # loess

- modular.  dyn can be used with any regression function that
  uses model.frame and is written in the style of lm.  Additional
  classes can be added to dyn simply by adding new methods. dyn
  is modular so such updates can be made without changing dyn, 
  itself. 

- documentation.  It includes a help page and six demos.

   ?dyn           # help file
   demo()         # look under dyn for list of demos
   demo("dyn-rq") # runs indicated dyn demo

The package is available on CRAN.  Comments/questions welcome.

Message-ID: <40e66e0b050610121126020323@mail.gmail.com>

I have uploaded version 0.96-1 of both Matrix and lme4 to CRAN.  The
source package should migrate to CRAN over the weekend and binary
packages should be available some time next week.

As for previous releases, the versions of these two packages are
interdependent.  The lme4 package requires Matrix_0.96-1 or later but
we cannot enforce the other dependency.  Please remember that if you
upgrade the Matrix package you should also upgrade the lme4 package.

The method for fitting generalized linear mixed models using the
Laplacian approximation is considerably faster in this version.  Also,
the packages have been reorganized so the interdependence will not be
as strong in the future.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New CRAN package sp: classes and methods for spatial data
Message-ID: <42B2DC1F.7090901@geog.uu.nl>

We're happy to announce the CRAN release of "sp", an R package which
has new-style classes and methods for spatial data, version 0.7-9.

Spatial data types that sp implements are: points, grids, lines, and
polygons (i.e., rings) optionally with holes. Methods include

+ the usual print, summary, plot, [, [[, $, ...
+ coercion between types (e.g. points and grids, matrices, data.frames)
+ coordinates(x), which returns the spatial coordinates of x
+ bbox(x), returns the coordinates bounding box of x
+ overlay, to query the value of e.g. points in polygons or grid
   (essentially does a point-in-polygon or point-in-raster cell)
+ spsample, for random sampling methods over a spatial domain.

An additional package (spproj) provides coordinate reference system
transformation (projection and re-projection) using the PROJ.4 library
[2]. Others (will) provide interfaces to GRASS 6 and gdal.

A good deal of work has also gone into providing plotting methods using
base, grid and lattice graphics, through the spplot function, a front-end
to lattice plots for spatial data (see gallery [1]).

The home page of these packages is found at
http://r-spatial.sourceforge.net/
See also the Task View on Spatial Data Analysis, linked from CRAN.

The reason why we wrote this package is that we think R is an excellent
environment to deal with spatial data, but that it lacks a uniform way
to deal with spatial data. Compared to the handling of dates and times,
which can utilize base classes or those provided in the chron package,
spatial data handling is much more fragmented. As a consequence:

- various packages make their own assumptions about how spatial data
   are organized
- spatial data organized for a certain package cannot easily be used
   for another package
- few (or no) packages address the full range of spatial data types
   (points, grids, lines, polygons) and their interaction
- generic spatial functionality (e.g. I/O to GIS, plotting, projection)
   is scattered and often limited in functionality.

It also means that many different package authors have to use time writing
similar data handling code, rather than concentrating on analytical
functions. If the sp package achieves its goals, data I/O will become
many-to-one, and data access for analysis one-to-many, providing a shared
data object layer for which shared methods can be written.

Classes and methods for spatial data are only useful when the spatial
packages support them. The sp development team includes maintainers of
a number of spatial R packages, on which we will work, and we hope that
over time other spatial package maintainers will also provide support
for the classes provided by this package.

Although we are working towards a fixed set of classes at this moment
of the development of sp we cannot fully guarantee that the exact
representation of the sp classes will not change in the future. Therefore,
we advise users to keep the scripts with instructions of building the
data into sp classes; it is most likely that we will not change the
building functions and methods.

Work in progress currently involves:
- support of sp classes by several spatial statistics packages
- automatic determination of hole polygons from shapefiles
- plotting filled polygons with holes
- gdal read/write support
- GRASS 6.0 support

The development of this package is a joint effort of Virgilio Gomez-Rubio,
Barry Rowlinson, Roger Bivand and Edzer Pebesma, and followed from
discussions held at a pre-DSC2003 workshop [3], announcements on R-sig-geo
[4], and a meeting held last November in Lancaster [5]. A beta release
of sp was announced a while ago on R-sig-geo [6].

With best regards,

The GLPK package is intended for solving large-scale linear programming
(LP), mixed integer linear programming (MIP), and other related problems.

The GLPK library includes the following main components:

* implementation of the simplex method;
* implementation of the primal-dual interior-point method;
* implementation of the branch-and-bound method;
* application program interface (API);
* GNU MathProg modeling language (a subset of AMPL);
* GLPSOL, a stand-alone LP/MIP solver.

Dear useRs,

a new package for tree-structured regression is available on CRAN.

This package implements a unified framework for recursive partitioning
which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined
theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on
multiple test procedures are implemented. The methodology is applicable
to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric,
censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary
measurement scales of the covariates. Extensible functionality for
visualizing tree-structured regression models is available.

Best,

Torsten

Message-ID: <20050705003039.563e6e9c.david.meyer@wu-wien.ac.at>

Dear useRs,

a completely revised version of the `vcd' ("Visualizing Categorical
Data") package is now
available from CRAN. This major revision includes the following
enhancements:

* grid-based:

The package is now entirely based on `grid', the new R graphics system,
thus exploiting
its unique functionalities. Powered by grid, it is now possible,
e.g., to simply compose complex plots of available components, or to
modify plot elements 
after they have been drawn.

* new flexible framework for mosaic and association plots

Extended mosaic and association plots are now integrated in a completely
new
generic framework for the visualization of contingency tables (so-called
`strucplots'). 
The new design modularizes labeling, shading, spacing, and drawing of
legends, and
also the cells' content by the use of panel functions.

Powerful labeling functions offer much more flexibility for adding
labels
(e.g., no restrictions on the number of dimensions, flexible positioning
of labels,
cell labeling, etc.)

The framework in particular includes many predefinded functions for the
creation of
residual-based shadings.

Convenience interfaces for various `flavors' of mosaic displays are
available, e.g., 
doubledecker plots, or visualizations of "loglm" objects with
residual-based shading.

* misc:

In addition, the package features several new data sets, and an
inference
function for (conditional) independence of margins in a contingency
table.


Happy drawing!

David, Achim, Kurt

batchfiles, available on CRAN at

   http://cran.r-project.org/contrib/extra/batchfiles/

consists of a set of Windows XP batch files (they may run on 
NT/2000 too but that has not been tested) which facilitate:

1. starting R, automatically locating it in the registry
   each time they are run, so that when a new version of 
   R is installed its not necessary to update them all 
   - Rcmd.bat, Rgui.bat, R.bat

2. copying configuration files to new versions of R when R
   is updated and optionally updating MiKTeX to be consistent 
   with a new R version.  After a one-time configuration just 
   run the batch file after each new download and install of R 
   - Rrefresh.bat

3. use of .Rbuildignore when checking and installing 
   R packages automatically running a build first and then 
   'Rcmd CHECK' or 'Rcmd INSTALL' in one step.  Also sets R_LIBS
   to .../R/library if R_LIBS has not already been set.
   - makepkgs.bat

4. locating various R tools that are used in building R packages
   on your system by querying the registry.
   - Rfind.bat

Comments welcome.

Subject: [R-pkgs] tseriesChaos ver. 0.1
Message-ID: <1122130908.8703.6.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Dear all,

I have uploaded to CRAN a new package: tseriesChaos.
This is an early version (0.1) with basic tools for the explorative
analysis of nonlinear time series motivated by chaos theory. Until now,
the package is largely inspired by the TISEAN project (by Rainer Hegger,
Holger Kantz and Thomas Schreiber:
http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~tisean/ ).

This version includes:
- Method of false nearest neighbours for the choice of the embedding
dimension.
- Tools for the estimation of the correlation dimension.
- Kantz algorithm for the estimation of the largest Lyapunov exponent.
- (naif) mutual information index estimation.
- Space-time separation plot.
- Recurrence plot.
- Simulation of noise-free continuous dynamic systems.

At the present time, algorithms are not too much optimized for speed, we
are working on optimizing the codes.
Future versions will (hopefully) include also code inspired from the
book of Chan and Tong (2001) (Chaos: A Statistical perspective) by
Springer as well as other contributions.
Checking was mainly done by comparing results with those available in
literature.
Any kind of feedback/help would be greatly appreciated.

Antonio, Fabio Di Narzo.

Version 0.98-1 of the lme4 package and of the Matrix package are now
on CRAN.  This version provides the adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature
(AGQ) method for fitting generalized linear mixed models.

A new generic function mcmcsamp has been added with a method for
objects in the "lmer" (linear mixed model fit or generalized linear
mixed-effects model fit) class.  This function provides a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo sample from the posterior distribution of the model
parameters.  The returned object has (S3) class "mcmc" and the
diagnostic functions in the coda package can be used on it.

Subject: [R-pkgs] [ANNOUNCE] mod_R: The R/Apache Integration Project
Message-ID: <42EF26AD.2050208@vanderbilt.edu>


   What is it?
   -----------
   mod_R is a project dedicated to embedding the R interpreter inside
   the Apache 2.0 (and beyond) web server for the purpose of writing web
   applications in R. It's composed of three parts:

   mod_R: the Apache 2.0 module that implements the glue to load the
   R interpreter.

   RApache: the R package that provides the API for programming web
   applications in R.

   libapreq 2.0.4: an Apache sponsored project for parsing request input.
   If you don't want to compile and install this version, then you can
   specify which libapreq2 library to use during configuration.

   The Latest Version
   ------------------

   Details of the latest version can be found at the mod_R
   project page:

http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/ApacheRproject

   (mind the wrap)


   Prerequisites
   -------------
   This release has been tested under Debian Linux with Apache 2.0.54,
   R 2.1.1, and libapreq 2.0.4.  Apache2 _MUST_ be compiled with the
   prefork MPM to compile mod_R. Also, R must have been compiled with
   the --enable-R-shlib configure flag.

   Installation
   ------------
   The following is the preferred way to compile and install mod_R:

     $ ./configure --with-apache2-apxs=/path/to/apxs --with-R=/path/to/R
     $ make
     $ make install

   Both --with-apache2-apxs and --with-R _MUST_ be specified.  Otherwise,
   trying to figure out the dependencies between the sources and headers
   and library paths becomes quite complex.

   If you don't want to compile and install the bundled libapreq2 version,
   then add --with-apreq2-config=/path/to/apreq2-config. The version _MUST_
   be equal to or greater than 2.0.4.

   Configuration
   -------------
   In order to use mod_R and RApache, you must configure apache to find
   it. Type help("directives",package="RApache") once mod_R is installed
   for a little more detail. Add something similar to this to the apache
   config file:

     LoadModule R_Module /path/to/mod_R.so

     <Location /URL>
        SetHandler r-handler
        Rsource /path/to/R/code.R
        RreqHandler function-name
        Rlibrary library-name
     </Location>

   Also, libR.so _MUST_ be found in the shared library path as it is
   linked to by mod_R, RApache and the rest of the packages containing
   shared libraries. You can either set LD_LIBRARY_PATH like this:

      $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`/path/to/R RHOME`/lib

   or add that path to /etc/ld.so.conf and then run ldconfig.

   NOTE: the latest apache2 debian packages cause the web server to run
   in a very reduced environment, thus one is unable to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   before calling /etc/init.d/apache2. One option is to actually edit that
   file and add the LD_LIBRARY_PATH explicitly. Another is to use the 
apache2ctl
   scripts which are also bundled with the debian packages. Or you can 
add it
   to /etc/ld.so.conf.

   Documentation
   -------------
   All of the documentation is currently in the RApache package. Once
   you install mod_R, start R and load the RApache package. You'll get
   a warning that you're currently not running the R interpreter within
   Apache; just don't try to run any of the code. Sample session:
    > library(RApache)
    Warning message:

    RApache is only useful within the Apache web server.
    It is loaded now for informational purposes only

     in: firstlib(which.lib.loc, package)
    > help(package="RApache")

Subject: [R-pkgs] new version of lattice
Message-ID: <200508052023.31632.deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>


[This is more a warning than an announcement]

A new version of lattice should be soon on CRAN. From this version onwards, 
all high-level lattice functions are (S3) generic. All of them have formula 
methods, some have other methods as well, formalizing the various non-formula 
uses which used to be handled by clumsy hacks in the past. There's also a new 
table method for barchart.

Ideally, this change should be completely transparent to the user and no 
existing code should break (except undocumented and inappropriate examples 
like 

dotplot( x  | a )

which used to work like dotplot(~x | a) before). However, Murphy's law usually 
prevails, so...

Subject: [R-pkgs] RGL v0.65
Message-ID: <14ce7bc2a2d0dd85e6b9e92332b528ec@uni-goettingen.de>

RGL Version 0.65 [r405 / 2005-08-14]

DESCRIPTION
The RGL package is a visualization device system for R, using
OpenGL as the rendering backend. An rgl device at its core
is a real-time 3D engine written in C++. It provides an
interactive viewpoint navigation facility (mouse + wheel support)
and an R programming interface.

RELEASE INFO
This is a Beta release. We target a stable release at the end of 
September 2005.

WHATS NEW
* A native Mac OS X / Carbon version is shipped with this release.
   No need to start an X11 Server.
   The X11 Port is still available, but configure defaults to use Carbon.

* The X11 port has been improved. The crash (using rgl.close() or 
rgl.quit()
   has been fixed.

* User-selectable mouse handlers featuring trackball navigation and
   interactive selection.

* A new interface concept "R3D" is available for preview and discussion
   using the function name pattern:
     XXX3d()

   The functions map to rgl functions internally (with some exceptions).

   Here's a short list of interesting spots in the interface API:

   * par3d() can be used to get/set values on the current RGL device.

   * Primitives functions such as points3d(), lines3d(), surface3d(), ...

   * First bunch of generic transformation utilities, rendering methods
     and mesh objects are implemented.

   The rgl interface using the pattern "rgl.XXX()" is still available.
   You can decide between more OpenGL/RGL'is low-level functions or
   more R'ish functions using the R3D interface concept.

* Rendering of blended surfaces using hierarchical z-sorting.

* New material property: Texture environment mapping

Subject: [R-pkgs] For2R - Interface from Fortran to R
Message-ID: <430B8250.9060308@noaa.gov>

We announce the availability of the Fortran 95 module "For2R", which 
makes it easy to write complicated R data structures (i.e., lists of 
lists, matrices, dataframes, ...) from Fortran programs. By a series of 
subroutine calls, program outputs can be written to a file readable by R 
with a single "dget" function call. This facilitates automated graphics 
generation and other postprocessing of model results.

A downloadable ZIP file of For2R is available from  
http://shrimp.ccfhrb.noaa.gov/~mprager/Rinter.html  and includes Fortran 
source, documentation, and an example.

We are working on similar code to interface C++ with R. An extremely 
crude version of such code is available from the same page. Though the 
C++ code will be totally replaced, the download includes sample output 
and R graphics functions for automated processing of a fisheries example. 

Although For2R is much nicer than our current C++ code, it should all be 
considered beta-test code, and it is supplied with no warranty 
whatsoever.  Bug reports and suggestions are welcome.

Message-ID: <009e01c5b211$cc248220$0540210a@www.domain>

Dear R-users,

We'd like to announce the release of our new package "grouped" 
(available from CRAN), for fitting models for grouped or coarse data, 
under the Coarsened At Random assumption. This is useful in cases 
where the true response variable is known only up to an interval in 
which it lies. Features of the package include: power calculations for 
two-group comparisons, computation of Bayesian residuals using 
Multiple Imputation, capability of fitting models for index-kind data 
(e.g., quality of life indexes). Any kind of feedback (questions, 
suggestions, bug-reports, etc.) is more than welcome.


Best,
Dimitris Rizopoulos

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0509072038490.7066-100000@reclus.nhh.no>

Revised versions of maptools, a package for reading geographical data from
shapefiles, and sp, a package with classes and methods for spatial data
handling, have been released on CRAN. They are maptools release 0.5-1 and
sp release 0.8-1.

The maptools package now depends on sp (>= 0.8), so that users of maptools
will need both to update the package itself, and to install the sp
package. All previous maptools classes and functions are still available,
but users are encouraged to try out the cleaner and more robust versions
in sp.

Further details of changes (particularly incompatible changes in sp) are
available on the R-sig-geo mailing list (see the "Spatial" task view on
CRAN), and at http://r-spatial.sourceforge.net

Message-ID: <20050909193749.TNWQ1799.tomts40-srv.bellnexxia.net@JohnDesktop8300>

Dear R-packages list members,

I've recently uploaded to CRAN version 1.1-1 of the Rcmdr ("R Commander")
package. Based on the tcltk package, the Rcmdr provides a basic-statistics
graphical interface to R.

The general functionality of the R Commander has not changed much since
version 1.0-0. There are some small improvements to the package, but the
reason that I'm re-announcing it is that the latest version supports
translation into other languages, using the new internationalization and
localization features of R 2.1.x. 

A Catalan translation (courtesy of Manel Salamero), a French translation
(courtesy of Philippe Grosjean), a Japanese translations (courtesy of
Takaharu Araki), and a Slovenian translation (courtesy of Jaro Lajovic), are
provided with the Rcmdr package. I understand that Portuguese, Russian, and
Spanish translations are in the works, and these will be incorporated when
they are completed. 

If you're interested in translating the Rcmdr into another language, please
contact me.

As before, bug reports, suggestions, and other feedback are appreciated.

Most notably the functionality of the orphaned package
"sound" has been merged into tuneR. Because tuneR's representation and

names of functions, argument ordering and expected objects) of package
"sound".

Message-ID: <f8e6ff05050922163639f6d954@mail.gmail.com>

Reshape version 0.5
===================

Reshape is an R package for flexibly restructuring and aggregating
data.  It's very much pivot table inspired, and it (hopefully) makes
it very easy to view your data the way you want.  You can find out
more at http://had.co.nz/reshape

The big news in this version of reshape is that I've renamed all the
functions so they no longer conflict with any built in functions -
deshape is now melt (think liquid data) and reshape is now cast (think
solidifying data into the form you want).

What else is new?

 * recast melts and casts your data in one step
 * column naming bugs fixed
 * easily display all margins with the argument margins=T in cast

Please let me know what you think.

Regards,

Hadley

Dear R users,

I'd like to announce the new version of the package "ltm" (available 
from CRAN), for fitting Latent Trait Models (including the Rasch and 
two-parameter logistic models) under the Item Response Theory 
approach. Three main extra features have been added: (i) now both 
ltm() and rasch() permit general fixed-value constraints (e.g., useful 
for scaling purposes), (ii) there is the option to report the 
estimated parameters under the usual IRT parameterization, and (iii) 
both plot.ltm() and plot.rasch() are now more flexible. For info about 
other new features check the help and CHANGES files. Future plans 
include development of functions for fitting the three-parameter 
logistic and the graded response models. Any kind of feedback 
(questions, suggestions, bug-reports, etc.) is more than welcome.

Best,
Dimitris

Subject: [R-pkgs] pls version 1.1-0
Message-ID: <m0mzlgmo0k.fsf@bar.nemo-project.org>

Version 1.1-0 of the pls package is now available on CRAN.

The pls package implements partial least squares regression (PLSR) and
principal component regression (PCR).  Features of the package include

- Several plsr algorithms: orthogonal scores, kernel pls and simpls
- Flexible cross-validation
- A formula interface, with traditional methods like predict, coef,
  plot and summary
- Functions for extraction of scores and loadings, and calculation of
  (R)MSEP and R2
- A simple multiplicative scatter correction (msc) implementation
- Functions for plotting predictions, validation statistics,
  coefficients, scores, loadings, biplots and correlation loadings.

The main changes since 1.0-3 are

- mvr, mvrCv and predict.mvr now has builtin support for scaling of X.
- A new function stdize for explicit centering and/or scaling.
- Correlation loadings plot (corrplot).
- New argument `varnames' in coefplot, to label the x tick marks with the
  variable names.
- loadingplot, coefplot and plot.mvrVal can now display legends, with the
  argument 'legendpos'.

See CHANGES in the sources for all changes.

Subject: [R-pkgs] vcd package 0.9-5 released
Message-ID: <20051020092945.7ba1dc7a.david.meyer@wu-wien.ac.at>


Dear useRs,

a new version of the vcd package (0.9-5) is now available from CRAN.

Apart from (a lot of) bug fixes, it includes the following new features
(some of them have 'silently' been included in previous bug fix
releases):

* Improved documentation:

  - an introductory vignette on the strucplot framework (including
    mosaic, association and sieve plots)
  - special vignettes on using/extending shading and labeling functions

* New function spine() for spinograms and spine plots

* New function cd_plot() for conditional density plots 

* New function cotabplot() for visualizing conditional independence in a
  trellis-like layout, providing panel functions for association,
  mosaic, and sieve plots

* Sieve plots are now integrated in the strucplot framework, sieve()
  replaces sieveplot()

* Extended support for 'structable' objects (textual representation of
  mosaic plots):

  - structable objects can be used as input for mosaic(), sieve(), and
    assoc()
  - extract ("[") and replacement ("[<-") functions are available (old
    "[[" method removed)
  - methods for t(), dim(), as.matrix(), as.vector(), as.table(), etc.
    are available

* New panel function pairs_diagonal_text() for pairs()

* The alternative legend function legend_fixed() now looks more similar
  to the legend of mosaicplot() in base R

Comments are more then welcome!

David, Achim, Kurt.

PS: If you like modern art, try out demo(mondrian)! :)

From: Peter.Ruckdeschel at uni-bayreuth.de (Peter Ruckdeschel)
Date: Sat, 22 Oct 2005 21:23:26 +0200
Subject: [R-pkgs] after package reorganization: version 1.6 of package
 "distr" available;
 new packages "distrEx", "distrSim", "distrTEst", "RandVar"
Message-ID: <435A91AE.4020109@uni-bayreuth.de>

After some reorganization, we would like to announce the availability
on CRAN of a new version (1.6) of our package "distr" as well as the
availabilty on CRAN of the new packages "distrEx", "distrSim",
"distrTEst", "RandVar".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from 1.5 to 1.6
-[former package "distr"] reorganization:
 we have split up our package distr into smaller units:
 * "distr" now only contains the (basic) classes and methods
           for distributions
 * "distrSim" requires "distr" and contains classes and methods
           for data / simulations formerly contained in "distr"
 * "distrTEst" requires "distr" and "distrSim" and contains
           classes and methods for evaluation of estimators
           at data / simulations formerly contained in "distr"
-[distrSim] under the hood: signature of method "simulate" adapted
            in order to prevent collision with corresponding method
            from the stats package
some more details to be found at
http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/departments/math/org/mathe7/DISTR
a more detailed manual is available at
http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/departments/math/org/mathe7/DISTR/distr.pdf

-additional packages by Matthias Kohl:
 * "distrEx" requires "distr" and contains some extensions to
           package "distr" (see later)
 * "RandVar" requires "distr" and "distrEx" and contains classes
           and methods for random variables (see later)
These two packages are described in some detail in Matthias' PhD Thesis
"Numerical Contributions to the Asymptotic Theory of Robustness", App. D
available on http://stamats.de/ThesisMKohl.pdf

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Descriptions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Description of "distr":
"distr" is to provide a conceptual treatment of random variables
(r.v.'s) by means of S4--classes. A virtual mother class "Distribution"
is introduced.
All distributions of the "base" package are implemented as subclasses of
either "AbscontDistribution" or "DiscreteDistribution".

Using these classes, we also provide (default) methods to automatically
generate the image distributions under unary mathematical operations as
well as a general convolution algorithm.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Description of "distrSim":
Classes and methods are provided for a standardized treatment of
simulations (also under contaminations) .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Description of "distrTEst":
Classes and methods are provided for a standardized treatment of
the evaluation of statistical procedures (up to now only estimators)
at data/simulations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Description of "distrEx":
This package provides some extensions to package "distr"
like:
* extreme value distribution classes,
*expectations
  +in the form E(X)  for the expectation of X where X is some
    distribution or
  +in the form E(X,f) for the expectation of f(X) where X is
     some distribution and f some function in X,
* truncated moments,
* distances between distributions
  (Hellinger, Kolmogorov, total variation, "convex contamination")
* lists of distributions,
* conditional distributions in factorized form 
* conditional expectations in factorized form
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Description of "RandVar":
This package introduces classes and methods for random
variables (understood as measurable mappings); in particular
groups Math and Arith as well as matrix multiplication  and
expectations are available so that quite general "regular" expressions
with random variables are possible.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New version of RQuantLib
Message-ID: <17253.35715.443094.418346@basebud.nulle.part>


A new version of RQuantLib has been uploaded to CRAN a few days ago (and
should be available at http://cran.r-project.org and all mirrors). Debian
binaries are also available.

Among the new features in version 0.2.0, all of which are due to excellent
contributions by Dominick Samperi, are
- new functions for Fixed Income support:
   * DiscountCurve for discount / forward / zero curve construction
   * BermudanSwaption provding several QuantLib pricers for Swaptions
- new internal R / C++ interface class RCpp
- Windows binary packages on CRAN 

Windows users can now install RQuantLib via the menu just like any other
package.  Debian users can still say 'apt-get install r-cran-rquantlib'. All
others can compile manually (which still requires Boost and QuantLib
headers).

We also have an experimental OpenGL demo of option analytics visualisation
via the rgl package.  However, there are some concerns over stability,
especially on platforms with ATI graphics card.  If you want to try it, do
 
> library(RQuantLib)
> source(url("http://basebud.nulle.part/~edd/code/rquantlib/OptionSurfaces.R"))

and let us know how it worked (or not) and what your platform is. We still
would like to release this in an upcoming revision.  A more fail-safe way,
using animated gifs of the demo's output, is available at

     http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rquantlib-rgl.html

Special thanks to Dominick Sapieri for the new code and all his testing and
building help, and to Uwe Ligges for help with the Windows binaries.

With best regards, Dirk

Message-ID: <2E1DE912-9603-4733-B00E-7450335F65E9@stanford.edu>

We have uploaded to CRAN the first version of glmpath,
which fits the L1 regularization path for generalized linear models.

The lars package fits the entire piecewise-linear L1 regularization  
path for
the lasso. The coefficient paths for L1 regularized glms, however,   
are not piecewise linear.
glmpath uses convex optimization - in particular predictor-corrector  
methods-
to fit the coefficient path at important junctions. These junctions  
are at the "knots" in |beta|
where variables enter/leave the active set; i.e.  nonzero/zero values.
Users can request greater resolution at a cost of more computation,  
and compute values
on a fine grid between the knots.

The code is fast, and can handle largish problems efficiently.
it took just over 4 sec system cpu time to fit the logistic  
regression path for
the "spam" data from UCI with 3065 training obs and 57 predictors.
For a microarray example with 5000 variables and 100 observations, 11  
seconds cpu time.

Currently glmpath implements binomial, poisson and gaussian families.

Brief description of changes:

CHANGES IN GDATA 2.1.2
-----------------------

 - Fixed bug in interleave.R - option to covert 1-column matrices to
   vector (based on Andrew Burgess's suggestion)

 - Updated Greg and Jim's email adresses

 - ll.R: Suppressed warning message in attach() call.

 - frameApply.Rd, reorder.Rd: Remove explicit loading of
   gtools in examples, so that failure to import functions from
   gtools gets properly caught by running the examples.

 - upperTriangle.R, man/upperTriangle.Rd: Add functions for
   extracting and modifying the upper and lower trianglular components of
   matrices.

 - is.what.R: Replaced the "not.using" vector with a more robust
   try(get(test)) to find out whether a particular is.* function
   returns a logical of length one.

-  DESCRIPTION: Added Suggests field

 -  Updated the example in frameApply

CHANGES IN GMODELS 2.12.0
-------------------------

- Updated Greg's email address.

- Add support for lmer (lme version 4) objects to ci(), estimable(),
  and fit.contrast() via code contributed by Randall C Johnson.

- Add simplfied coefficient specification to estimable() based on a
  function provided by Randall C Johnson.  It is now possible to do
  things like:
        estimable(reg, c("xB"=1,"xD"=-1))
  instead of:
        estimable(reg, c(    0,   1,     0,   -1))
  which should make estimable() much easier to use for large models.

CHANGES IN GPLOTS 2.2.0
-----------------------

 - plotmeans.R: Fixed bug in plotmeans - based on Stefano Calza's
                suggestion (the function didn't account for factors
                unused levels, returning an error.)

 - exported plot.lm to NAMESPACE, Remove .Alias calls in plot.lm.R
                since .Alias is defunct.

 - barplot2.R: Changed the default greay colors to heat colors, if
               height is matrix

 - Updated Greg's email address

 - balloonplot.R: Recent changes to align row totals with the
                  overall total broke how the marginal cumulative
                  fractions were displayed. Added example using
                  Titanic data that exercises the multi-factor display.
                  Added -.tex, .pdf files and figuers, and RNEWS article
                  in inst/doc

 - colorpanel.R: colorpanel now allows only 2 colors to be specified
                 if no 'middle' color is desired.

CHANGES IN gtools 2.2.2
-----------------------

 -  src/setTCPNoDelay.c: Add C source code for setTCPNoDelay.

 -  NAMESPACE: Add UseDynLib to NAMESPACE so the shared library gets
               properly loaded.

 - Updated Greg's email address.

  - New function 'addLast' that adds functions to R's .Last() so
    that they will be executed when R is terminating.

  - New function setTCPNoDelay() that allows the TCP_NODELAY flag to
    be changed on socket objects.

  in private mail and I will refrain from posting in the future.  -- Dirk ]



(Please see note [1] below regarding recipients for this posting. Thanks!)


Executive Summary: 

    Quantian 0.7.9.1 is the first Quantian release based on Knoppix 4.0.2.
    Quantian adds hundreds of scientific / numeric packages, as well as the
    openMosix enabled 2.4.27 kernel, to the cdrom version of Knoppix. 
    
    Relative to the previous release 0.6.9.3, hundreds of applications have
    been updated, and many new applications (such as polyxmass, scigraphica,
    kst, octaviz, gromacs) have been added. Quantian now contains over 2400
    Debian packages, and over 800 packages for R.

    Quantian comes as one bootable dvd iso of 2.5gb (compressed) with
    almost 7 gb (uncompressed) of software of interest to quantitative 
    analysts, scientists, researchers or students.


Announcing Quantian release 0.7.9.1
===================================


I   What is it?

    Quantian is a remastering of Knoppix, the self-configuring and directly
    bootable cdrom/dvd that turns any pc or laptop into a full-featured Linux
    workstation, and (parts of) clusterKnoppix, which adds support for
    openMosix-based  cluster computing. However, Quantian differs from
    Knoppix by having a particular focus on quantitative, numerical or 
    scientific applications, and hence adds a very large set of programs of
    interest to applied or theoretical workers in quantitative or data-driven
    fields to the solid base provided by Knoppix.

    See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian.html for more details.

    
II What Quantian highlights should I care about ?

    o First release based on Knoppix 4.0.2: Derived from the cdrom version of
      Knoppix, Quantian utilises the unionfs setup of Knoppix to combine two
      compressed loop images for a total of 2.5 gb (from two files of 2.0 gb
      and 425 mb) corresponding to almost 7 gb of software.

    o KDE 3.4, Kernel 2.6.12; added backport of kernel 2.4.27 with openMosix
      patch for continued openMosix support [ but note that openMosix and
      unionfs seem to conflict so kernel 2.4.27 only sees the first
      compressed loop image ]

    o Some highlights in 0.7.9.1 are
      
      - very complete R support with over 800 packages (28 from 'core R',
        another 70 from Debian packages, and 724 directly installed from
        CRAN and BioConductor, covering over 99% of all packages at CRAN
        and BioConductor [ not counting a handful of windows-only CRAN
        packages ] ), ESS editing in Emacs/XEmacs, GGobi visualization,

    o See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/changelog.html for details.

    o See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/howto.html for several
      short HOWTOs on booting Quantian from hd on either Windows or Linux,
      booting via a bootcd (such as clusterKnoppix), or botting from a 
      USB memory device.  Contributions, corrections, and feedback on these
      HOWTOs is always appreciated.


III Where do I get it?

    o Downloads are available from the main host at Seattle at FHCRC:

            http://quantian.fhcrc.org/
	    rsync://quantian.fhcrc.org/quantian/
      
      and at the East Coast at 

            http://research.warnes.net/downloads/quantian/CURRENT/
	    ftp://research.warnes.net/users/edd/quantian/CURRENT/

      The most recent release is also available at

            http://quantian.alioth.debian.org/

      Note that file size of 2.5 gb may upset web caching system such
      as squid. It may be best to rely on rsync or bittorrent instead
      of http.

    o Bittorrents should be available shortly at

            http://www.tlm-project.org/public/distributions/quantian/

    o The main European mirrors should catch up shortly:

            http://sunsite.rediris.es/mirror/quantian

            http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/ftp/pub/Linux/quantian

    o CD/DVD vendors will probably update their offerings soon as well. 
      See the Quantian site for a list.


IV  Mailing lists

    o Two mailing lists exist for Quantian

        quantian-announce	  for announcements, intended to be low volume
        quantian-general	  for general discussions about Quantian

      available via

	http://alioth.debian.org/mail/?group_id=30303

      for subscription info etc., and start using the quantian-general lists
      for general questions, comments, suggestions or discussions about 
      Quantian.

      Quantian-general is subscribed to quantian-announce, so you only need
      to subscribe to one (but can of course subscribe to both).  Posting to
      quantian-general requires a subscription. 

      Reply-To: for this message is quantian-general at lists.alioth.debian.org
      so that discussions can be continued on the list.


V  Known Bugs in 0.7.9.1

    o Debian's current C++ transition affects the KDE packages. Several 
      packages had to be installed from the stable relase, and a few
      (celestia, gdal) are currently uninstallable. This should should
      improve over the next few weeks/months.
     
    o Kdvi is broken. However, xdvi works as do the various pdf previewers
      so (PDF)LaTeX use is still possible.

    o As noticed above, when openMosix and kernel 2.4.27 are used, the
      second compressed loop image is not accessible implying that the 
      /opt, /usr/games, /usr/lib/j2se, /usr/share/doc, /usr/src, /usr/NX
      directories are not accessible.


VI   Other items

    o Feedback / poll on package additions or removal

      As always, I welcome comments and suggestions about programs to be
      added or removed. Existing Debian packages, and possibly existing
      rpm packages, typically get inserted quite readily.

      Please send feedback, questions, comments, ... to the 
      
	quantian-general at lists.alioth.debian.org

      list to maximise the number of eyes glancing at any one question.
      Notice that a subscription to the list is needed in order to post.

    o Feedback would also be appreciated on ways to better communicate with
      difference scientific communities that could be interested in Quantian.


VII Notes

    [1] This email is sent via the quantian-announce mailing list. I have
        subscribed those whose email addresses are in my quantian mail folder
        due to prior emails. The quantian-announce mailing list only sends
        moderator-approved posts -- so there should be no spam whatsoever.
        Anybody who considers this unwanted is kindly asked to send me a
        private mail to get unsubscribed immediately. Otherwise, replies and
        follow-ups should go to   
		quantian-general at lists.alioth.debian.org
	where posting may require an initial subscription.



Best regards,  Dirk

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package: MatchIt
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0501111309520.4433@stat.harvard.edu>

We would like to announce the release of our software MatchIt, now 
available on CRAN.   MatchIt implements a variety of matching methods for 
causal inference.  

Abstract:
MatchIt implements the suggestions of Ho, Imai, King, and Stuart (2004) 
for improving parametric statistical models by preprocessing data with 
nonparametric matching methods. MatchIt implements a wide range of 
sophisticated matching methods, making it possible to greatly reduce the 
dependence of causal inferences on hard-to-justify, but commonly made, 
statistical modeling assumptions. The software also easily fits into 
existing research practices since, after preprocessing data with MatchIt, 
researchers can use whatever parametric model they would have used without 
MatchIt, but produce inferences with substantially more robustness and 
less sensitivity to modeling assumptions. MatchIt is an R program, and 
also works seamlessly with Zelig.

For more information, please see http://gking.harvard.edu/matchit/.  
Comments and suggestions are welcome.  

Sincerely,
Daniel Ho, Kosuke Imai, Gary King, and Elizabeth Stuart

Dear all,

I have just uploaded to CRAN the version 1.2 of the package
'adehabitat'. This package now contains new functions for
the estimation of home ranges (Nearest neighbour convex
hull, brownian bridge approach for kernel estimation),
estimation of schoener's ratio.  This package now allows a
better management of objects of class "area" (see plot.area,
perarea, ararea). Some arguments of the graphical functions
have also been changed (kernel, image.kasc, scatter.enfa).
Finally, some minor bugs have been corrected. Note that
the package now need that the packages ade4 and gpclib
are installed.

Questions, comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Happy testing,

Subject: [R-pkgs] New package for microeconomics: micEcon
Message-ID: <200502211256.45195.ahenningsen@email.uni-kiel.de>

Dear all,

I have uploaded a new package called micEcon (version 0.1-3) to CRAN 
(an early version of this package has been already presented at useR! 2004).
It contains tools for microeconomic analysis and microeconomic modeling.
These are for instance:

- tools for demand analysis with the 'Almost Ideal Demand System' (AIDS): 
e.g. econometric estimation, calculation of price and income/expenditure 
elasticities, checking for theoretical consistency

- tools for production/firm analysis with the 'Symmetric Normalized 
Quadratic' (SNQ) profit function: e.g. econometric estimation, calculation of 
price elasticities and shadow prices, imposing convexity

- tools for quadratic and translog functions, e.g. econometric estimation, 
calculation of Hessians and derivatives

- functions to write input files for and read output files of Tim Coelli's 
(1996) program "Frontier 4.1" (http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/cepa/ 
software.htm). In this way R can use "Frontier 4.1" to perform stochastic 
frontier analysis.

- a function to perform a two-step Heckman ("heckit") estimation to correct 
for non-random sample selection

- functions to calculate "Laspeyres", "Paasche" or "Fisher" price and quantity 
indices


I have checked most of the functions by comparing their results with values 
published in the literature or obtained by other software. However, I cannot 
guarantee that they return correct results in all possible cases. So please 
check these functions (results, code) and send me bug reports or patches.
You are also invited to provide further functions, e.g. tools for other 
functional forms.

Best regards,
Arne

Message-ID: <200502281503.50641.tobias.sing@mpi-sb.mpg.de>

Dear R users,

we are glad to announce the release of our new R package ROCR, for visualizing 
the performance of scoring classifiers (available on CRAN). We hope that the 
package might be useful for those of you working on classification problems. 
For details, see the package description below, or the ROCR website: 
http://rocr.bioinf.mpi-sb.mpg.de. You can get a short overview by typing 
'demo(ROCR)'. Any kind of feedback (questions, comments, suggestions, bug 
reports) is very welcome.

Best regards,
  the ROCRs (Tobias Sing, Oliver Sander, Niko Beerenwinkel, Thomas Lengauer)

Package description:
-------------------------
ROC graphs, sensitivity/specificity curves, lift charts, and precision/recall 
plots are popular examples of trade-off visualizations for specific pairs of 
performance measures. ROCR is a flexible tool for creating 
cutoff-parametrized 2D performance curves by freely combining two from over 
25 performance measures (new performance measures can be added using a 
standard interface). Curves from different cross-validation or bootstrapping 
runs can be averaged by different methods, and standard deviations, standard 
errors or box plots can be used to visualize the variability across the runs. 
The parametrization can be visualized by printing cutoff values at the 
corresponding curve positions, or by coloring the curve according to cutoff. 
All components of a performance plot can be quickly adjusted using a flexible 
parameter dispatching mechanism. Despite its flexibility, ROCR is easy to 
use, with only three commands and reasonable default values for all optional 
parameters.

New on CRAN: phpSerialize Version 0.8
Dieter Menne, dieter.menne at menne-biomed.de

Serializes R objects for PHP import into an associative array. 
Main use is for building web pages with R-support. 

Has mainly been tested with lm,lme, nlme and their summaries.

A web example is provide, showing

-- How to start R from php/Apache
-- How to pass variables from php to R via Environment
-- How to create serialized php output from R
-- How to read the serialize output from php/Apache via pipe
-- How to display individual results in a table
-- How to display the structure of the associative array.

For example, the following R structure...

  Delta=as.numeric(Sys.getenv("DELTA")) # Get Info from php
  wc = wilcox.test(rnorm(10),rnorm(10)+Delta)

... is is piped to standard output
  cat(phpSerialize(wc),"\n")

... and after deserialization

  $pp = popen("$Rterm --no-save  --slave  2>&1 < $RFile DELTA=$Delta","r");
  // Read serialized R output via pipe.
  $sWilcox=fgets($pp);
  pclose($pp);
  $Wilcox=unserialize($sWilcox);
  print_r($Wilcox);

... prints as follows:

Array
(
  [statistic] => Array
  (
    [W] => 29
  )

  [parameter] => 
  [p.value] => 0.1230055
  [null.value] => Array
  (
    [mu] => 0
  )
  [alternative] => two.sided
  [method] => Wilcoxon rank sum test
  [data.name] => rnorm(10) and rnorm(10) + Delta
)

Message-ID: <207fa1db08ad58cc37bcf4eceb887741@soc.soton.ac.uk>

Announcing the release of a new R package ResistorArray.


This package solves the (nontrivial) general problem of resistance on 
arbitrary (finite)
resistor arrays.

Outside electrical engineering, the problem has a wide range of 
applications to
situations such as groundwater modelling; there is a direct 
correspondence
between electrical networks and random walks.

The package has a reasonably complete set of literature references, and 
solves a number
of classical problems such as the resistance between opposite points of 
a skeleton resistor
cube, and the Wheatstone bridge.

The package comes with a variety of standard resistor arrays, including 
all five platonic
solids, the Fibonacci ladder, and "N" arbitrary resistors in series.

The package gives nice numerical illustrations of a few theoretical 
results from the
recent (2004) literature.

One of the Google aptitude tests was to determine the electrical 
resistance between two points
on an infinite grid of resistors. I couldn't solve this problem 
analytically (although I found the
other day that a solution does exist);  ResistorArray gets the answer 
correct to within about 1%.

Subject: [R-pkgs] msm version 0.5 released
Message-ID: <422ED490.8040307@imperial.ac.uk>

A major update of the "msm" package for continuous-time Markov and
hidden Markov multi-state models is now available from CRAN.

Hidden Markov models with general, continuous response distributions are
now supported.  These models are used for Markov processes which can
only be observed through the value of some noisy marker.

Censored states are now supported at any observation time.  The
observation scheme is also allowed to be different for each observation,
for example, process snapshot / fully-observed histories /
partially-observed histories such as death times.

Users upgrading from previous versions of msm should note that
some of the syntax for specifying models has changed.  In particular,
initial values are now specified in the "qmatrix" and "covinits"
arguments instead of the inits argument, so that "qmatrix" is no longer
a matrix of 0/1 indicators.

As always, refer to the user guide "msm-manual.pdf" in the "doc"
subdirectory for a full description of the methodology, and worked
examples in the use of the package.  See the appendix for a full
list of the syntax changes, and the NEWS file in the top-level
installation directory for a full list of the changes in this release.

Subject: [R-pkgs] mgcv 1.2-0
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0503111253460.28840@moon.stats.gla.ac.uk>

mgcv version 1.2 is on CRAN now. mgcv provides generalized additive models 
and generalized additive mixed models with automatic estimation of the 
smoothness of model components. 

Changes in this version are:

* A new gam fitting method is implemented for the generalized case. It 
provides more reliable convergence than the previous default, but can be 
a little slower.  See ?gam.method, ?gam.fit2 and ?gam.outer for details. 
The old method is still available as an option.

* `gam' has acquired a new list argument `method' to cope with the number 
of fitting  method options now available, and there has been some alteration 
to the `control' argument.

* Any smoothers can now be used to construct nested models, including 
tensor product smooths. See ?fixDependence and ?gam.side for details.

* By default all smooths are now parameterized to be centred, without 
requiring additional constraints (this is automatic and applies also to 
user defined smooths). The old behaviour is still available as an option. 
See ?smoothCon for details. (This should be user transparent.) 

* Smoothing parameter initialization has been modified for better 
performance with tensor product smooths. See ?initial.sp.

* By default, tensor product smooths have been modified to use more 
interpretable penalties. See ?te for details. This leaves smooths based 
on the default basis unchanged, but improves the performance of smooths 
based on other marginal bases.

* Examples of how to obtain variance estimates etc. efficiently, for any 
quantities derived from a fitted gam model are provided in ?predict.gam.

Dear R-users,

I'd like to announce the release of my new package "ltm" (available 
from CRAN), for fitting Latent Trait Models (including the Rasch 
model) under the Item Response Theory approach. The latent trait model 
is the analogous of the factor analysis model for Bernoulli response 
data. "ltm" fits the linear one- and two-factor models but also allows 
for inclusion of nonlinear latent terms (e.g., interaction and 
quadratic). Any kind of feedback (questions, suggestions, bug-reports, 
etc.) is more than welcome.

Best,
Dimitris

Message-ID: <424C6F94.6060706@uni-bayreuth.de>

We would like to announce the availability on CRAN of a new version (1.5)
of our package "distr" .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from 1.4 to 1.5

-package is now using /lazy loading/ 
-minor changes in the help pages
-minor enhancements in plot for distributions 
 (Gamma, discrete distributions)
-package now includes a demo - folder; try /demo("distr")/
-class /Gamma/ has been renamed /Gammad/ to avoid name collisions
-we have a CITATION file now; consider /citation("distr")/
-enhanced demos:
  +convolution of uniform variables now includes exact expressions
  +min/max of two variables now available for discrete distributions
-rd-Files have now a keyword entry for distribution and thus may be
 found by the search engine
-exact formula for  "Unif" o "numeric" where o \in { +,-,*,/ }

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Description of "distr":
"distr" is to provide a conceptual treatment of random variables
(r.v.'s) by means of S4--classes. A virtual mother class "Distribution" 
is introduced.
All distributions of the "base" package are implemented as subclasses of
either "AbscontDistribution" or "DiscreteDistribution".

Using these classes, we also provide (default) methods to automatically
generate the image distributions under unary mathematical operations as
well as a general convolution algorithm.

Additionally, we also provide classes for a standardized treatment of
simulations (also under contaminations) and evaluations of statistical
procedures on such simulations.

Subject: [R-pkgs] perturb package for evaluating collinearity
Message-ID: <20050331221639.5642.qmail@web52703.mail.yahoo.com>

I've uploaded the R package "perturb" to CRAN. Perturb contains two
programs for evaluating collinearity. "Colldiag" calculates condition
indexes and variance decomposition proportions to detect and track
down collinear sets of variables. 

"Perturb" takes a different approach. It re-estimates the model a
specified number of times, adding random noise ("perturbations") to
selected variables at each iteration. Categorical variables are
randomly reclassified. A summary then displays the impact of these
perturbations on the stability of the coefficients. Perturb is not
limited to linear regression and can handle interaction effects and
transformations of independent variables.

Version 1 of perturb was available from my website. This new version
makes it much easier to reclassify categorical variables. In
addition, colldiag now has a "fuzz" option to suppress printing of
small variance decomposition values.

Comments and criticisms invited,
John Hendrickx

Subject: [R-pkgs] Version 0.95-1 of the lme4 package
Message-ID: <424D90A4.3060600@stat.wisc.edu>

This may sound like an April Fool's joke but it isn't really.

I just uploaded version 0.95-1 of the lme4 package for R.  This is the 
package with the new versions of the lme (linear mixed-effects) function 
for R and the GLMM (generalized linear mixed models) function.

One distinguishing feature of the 0.95 series of releases of this 
package is the absence of the lme and GLMM functions.  They have been 
replaced by a single function called lmer (pronounced "Elmer").  The 
name could stand for "lme revised" or for "lme for R".

The method of specifying models for lmer is slightly different from that 
for lme, which is the reason for using a new name for this function.  In 
lmer the random effects terms and their grouping factors are specified 
in the formula.  Furthermore, if a family argument is given then a 
generalized linear mixed model is fit - otherwise a linear mixed model 
is fit.

I am writing an article for the next edition of R News describing the 
changes from lme to lmer.  In the meantime you can look at the examples 
and the tests directory of the mlmRev package to see examples of 
specifying lmer models.

My apologies for springing this on the community without warning.  I had 
planned to do a bit more development and create more documentation 
before releasing this new version but yesterday I accidently triggered a 
cascade of inconsistencies by uploading a new version of the Matrix package.

If you are using the current lme4 and prefer not to make changes at this 
time then stay with the 0.9 series of releases and don't update to 0.95-1.

Message-ID: <20050412185548.56646.qmail@web52701.mail.yahoo.com>

I've uploaded a new version of "catspec" to CRAN. Catspec is for
estimating certain "special categorical" models. It also contains
"ctab", a function for creating one-way, two-way, and multi-way
percentage tables (nothing special there really). Ctab can now print
more than one percentage type, as well as table marginals.

The first special model in catspec is "mclgen". Mclgen restructures a
data frame so a multinomial logistic model can be estimated using a
condition logit program. Doing so provides much more flexibility for
imposing restrictions on the response variable.

The second special (set of) models is "sqtab", for estimating
loglinear models for square tables (aka "mobility models") such as
symmetry, quasi-independence. One application can be to specify such
models as multinomial logistic models with covariates, using mclgen.

Message-ID: <20050416162729.SGNL25800.tomts13-srv.bellnexxia.net@JohnDesktop8300>

Dear list members,

I've just uploaded version 1.0-0 of the Rcmdr package to CRAN. For people
who haven't seen the package before, the "R Commander" provides a
basic-statistics graphical user interface to R, based on the tcltk package.
The new version incorporates a number of improvements to the R Commander
interface, as documented in the CHANGES file distributed with the package,
and I feel that the package is now sufficiently polished and stable to
warrant finally bumping the version number to 1.0-0.

More details are available at
<http://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/index.html> and in the
manual distributed with the package and accessible through the R Commander
"Help -> Introduction to the R Commander" menu.

As usual, comments, suggestions, etc., are appreciated.

John

Dear useRs,

RWinEdt_1.7-0 has been released.

Windows users of R-2.1.0 (which is scheduled to be released today) who 
are going to use a translated (i.e. non-english) version of RGui 
together with WinEdt will have to upgrade.

It is not advisable to upgrade RWinEdt for R versions < 2.1.0.

RWinEdt can be used in form of an R package (e.g. by saying 
install.packages("RWinEdt") within R-2.1.0) and as a manually 
installable WinEdt Plug-In.

Message-ID: <1114352087.14892.669.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Together with Alessio Boattini of the University of Bologna we have
created a package called Biodem. Biodem provides a number of functions
for Biodemographycal analysis, and we hope it will be useful to the
anthropological community.

Because Biodem contains all the functions found in Malmig (a package I
maintain), I would like to orphan it, or, even better, have it removed
from CRAN.

Finally, Biodem has been build on a Debian Linux box and is therefore
not yet available for Windows/OS X; Biodem was built with R 2.0.1
because I am using Debian 'testing' and the new R 2.1.0 is not yet
available for 'testing'. I will upload Biodem 0.2 as soon as I can build
it with R 2.1.

We have just put a package GPArotation on CRAN. The functions in this 
package perform an number of different orthogonal and oblique rotations 
for factor analysis, using the gradient projection algorithm described 
in Coen A. Bernaards and Robert I. Jennrich  (2005),  "Gradient 
Projection Algorithms and Software for Arbitrary Rotation Criteria in 
Factor Analysis, ", Educational and Psychological Measurement (in 
press).  Additional details are available on the web site  
<http://www.stat.ucla.edu/research/gpa>.

The following rotations are available:

Other rotations can be fairly easily added simply by coding a small 
function to calculate the rotation criterion objective function, and 
its gradient. A detailed example of gradient computation is in the

Message-ID: <20050428125820.2d776c5d.Achim.Zeileis@R-project.org>

Dear useRs,

a new version of the zoo package for totally ordered observations is
available from CRAN. It contains many new features, the most important
of which are: support of regular time series, an improved merge method
and functions for carrying out rolling analyses of time series. A more
detailed list of changes and new features is given below.

All features (both old and new) are also documented in the package
vignette.

Best wishes,
Z


Changes in Version 0.9-9

  o regular "zoo" series: objects of class "zooreg" (inheriting from
    "zoo") can be used to store strictly regular series (similar to "ts"
    objects) or series with an underlying regularity (as before but with
    observations omitted). They have a frequency attribute that can be
    used for conversion between "zoo" and "ts". The function
    is.regular() can be used for checking the regularity of a series.

  o improved merge() method: merge.zoo now accepts non-zoo arguments
    (other than first) if all non-zoo args have the same NROW value
    as the first argument (or are scalar). In that case the non-zoo
    args are given the index of the first series. Scalars are added
    for the full index of the merged series.

  o merge() zoo can now optionally return a "data.frame" that contains
    the numeric columns as "zoo" series and the "zoo" objects created
    from factors converted back to "factor".
    
  o [.zoo allows now indexing using observations from the index scale
    (and not only observation numbers).

  o rapply, rollmean, rollmax, rollmedian to perform rolling analyses

  o extended functionality to plot.zoo type argument

  o when plot.zoo used with one series list(...) can be omitted from 
    various plotting parameter arguments

  o print.zoo documentation fix for R 2.1.0

  o yearmon and yearqtr datetime classes

  o head.ts, tail.ts

  o c.zoo, range.zoo

  o coredata.default, coredata.ts

Message-ID: <20050428125843.7ce8f7a8.Achim.Zeileis@R-project.org>

Dear useRs,

recently, there were several discussions on R-help about how to
conveniently fit dynamic linear models and time series regressions. The
package dynlm tries to address this problem by 1. providing some more
functions like lags L() and differences d() and season() in the formula
specification of a model and 2. preserving the time series attributes of
the data. 

A first version of the dynlm package (which depends on the newest zoo
version) is now available from CRAN. For more information look at the
man pages and examples in the package.

Feedback is more than welcome.

Best wishes,
Z

Dear useRs,

a new version of the lmtest package is available from CRAN. Thanks to
Giovanni Millo who provided the initial versions of several new
functions (and many helpful discussions), there is new functionality for
the comparison of nested and non-nested linear models.

For non-nested model comparisons, the Cox test, encompassing test and 
J test are now available.

For nested model comparisons, there is the function waldtest() which
allows convenient specification of the models and into which H(A)C
estimates can be plugged. Thus, waldtest() can be seen as the
`econometric' counterpart to the anova() method, just as coeftest() can
be seen as the `econometric' counterpart of summary() for "lm" objects.

Dear RWinEdt users,

unfortunately, it seems to be impossible to support localized (i.e. 
translated) versions of RGui in MDI mode. The support of this feature 
has been removed now. All the workarounds I tried caused bugs (as many 
of you told me re. RWinEdt_1.7-0). Thanks for all the bug reports!

It is recommended to use the new version of RWinEdt (1.7-1) together 
with RGui in SDI mode (which should work with arbitrary translations).
Further on, only english versions of RGui in MDI mode are supported by 
RWinEdt.

Message-ID: <42830A0F.2010206@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr>

Dear all,

I have just uploaded to CRAN the version 1.3 of the
package 'adehabitat'. Significant changes are
listed below:

- Several functions allowing the conversion from
  and to classes of the package sp have been added.
  Maps of class "asc", "kasc", "area", as well as
  radio-monitoring of class "traj" can now be
  converted to the spatial classes available in sp.

- The function buffer.line() allows to compute buffer
  around a line

- The function distfacmap() converts one factor map
  into a set of maps giving the distance to the
  patches belonging to the different levels.

- The kernel home-range estimation can now be fitted
  using an Epanechnikov kernel (though it is still
  optional), resulting in a quicker estimation.

- The former function enfa() has been modified. It
  now requires a data frame (available units) and
  a vector (use of each unit). If the data consist
  of a point pattern and of an object kasc, the
  function data2enfa is to be used before.

- The function angles() now takes an argument
  indicating how successive relocations
  located at the same place have to be managed.

- The function as.traj now requires at least 2
  relocations to return a trajectory

- That's all, thanks for reading !

Questions, comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.
Happy testing,

There is a new version of the 'mvbutils' package (v1.1.1) available on

For existing users, the main new features are:

(i) 'help' now works properly with with R2.0+ (!)
(ii) 'mvbutils' is now NAMESPACEd, so you can avoid naming conflicts
with other packages. (Many functions are no longer user-visible.
(iii) Lazy-loading of individual objects is now available. Among other
things, this speeds up the use of 'cd' immensely with workspaces that
contain large objects.
(iv) better-organized interactions between 'history' and 'cd'.

For new users, the main features of 'mvbutils' are:

  * Hierarchical organization of projects and sub-projects, allowing
switching within a single R session, searching and moving objects
through the hierarchy, objects in ancestor projects always visible from
child (sub)projects, etc.

  * Improved function editing facilities, interfacing with whichever
text editor you prefer. The R command line is not frozen while editing,
and you can have multiple edit windows open. There is also a complete
automatic backup system, with (as a side-effect) the ability to sort
objects by date.

  * "Lazy loading" for individual objects, allowing fast & efficient
access to collections of biggish objects where only a few objects are
used at a time.

  * Support for flat-format (plain-text) documentation, stored along
with a function and editable at the same time, and viewable through
normal 'help'. Automatic conversion to Rd format is available if certain
rules are followed.

  * Support for nesting of 'source' calls, and for interspersing R code
and data in the same file.

  * Support for easy macro-like functions which act in their caller's
environment (see also RNews 1/3), and for "dynamically scoped"
functions.

  * Graphical display of which functions call which other functions.

  * numerous other lower-level utility functions and operators.

Please let me know of any comments and bug reports.

Message-ID: <4D99275E380CA94F998977EDACE548DC1AE6D3@extas2-hba.tas.csiro.au>

There is a new version of the 'debug' package (v1.1.0) available on
CRAN. For existing users, the main changes are (i) some bug fixes, and
(ii) it is now NAMESPACEd, so you can avoid naming conflicts with other
packages.

For new users, 'debug' is an alternative to 'trace' and 'browser',
offering:

	*  a visible code window with line-numbered code and highlighted
execution point;

	*  the ability to set (conditional) breakpoints in advance, at
any line number;

	*  the opportunity to keep going after errors;

	*  multiple debugging windows open at once (when one debuggee
calls another, or itself);

	*  full debugging of 'on.exit' code;

	*  the ability to move the execution point around without
executing intervening statements;

	*  direct interpretation of typed-in statements, as if they were
in the function itself.
	
See R-news 3.3 for an article on using this package.
	
Please let me know of any comments and bug reports.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.51.0506030855240.564@artemis.imbe.med.uni-erlangen.de>


Conditional Inference Procedures in a Permutation Test Framework

The `coin' package implements a general framework for conditional
inference procedures, commonly known as permutation tests,
theoretically derived by Strasser & Weber (1999). The conditional
expectation and covariance for a broad class of multivariate linear
statistics as well as the corresponding multivariate limiting distribution
was derived by Strasser & Weber (1999). These results are
utilized to construct tests for independence between two sets of
variables.

Beside a general implementation of the abstract framework the package
offers a rather huge set of convenience functions implementing well
known classical as well as less prominent classical and non-classical test
procedures in a conditional inference framework. Examples are linear rank
statistics for the two- and K-sample location and scale problem against
ordered and unordered alternatives including post-hoc tests for arbitrary
contrasts, tests of independence for contingency tables, two- and K-sample
tests for censored data, tests for independence of two continuous
variables as well as tests for marginal homogeneity and symmetry.
Conditional counterparts of most of the classical procedures given in
famous text books like Hollander & Wolfe (1999) or Agresti (2002) can be
implemented as part of the general framework without much effort.
Approximations of the exact null distribution via the limiting
distribution and conditional Monte-Carlo procedures are available for
every test while the exact null distribution
is currently available for two-sample problems only.

Inference problems can be specified by a traditional formula based
interface. Support for data available as `exprSet' objects in a BioC
environment is implemented as well. The theoretical framework is sketched
in the vignette and we refer to `vignette("coin")' for further details.

Comments, suggestions, bug-reports etc. are more than welcome!

Best,

Torsten, Kurt, Mark and Achim

                 contours, computed by the marching cubes algorithm.

   image3d       Crude 3d analog of image() using rgl to plot points on a
 		three dimensional grid representing values in a three
 		dimensional array. Assumes high values are inside and
 		uses alpha blending to make outside points more
 		transparent.

   lines3d       Draws connected line segments in an rgl window.

   parametric3d  Plots a two-parameter surface in three dimensions in
                 rgl.  Based on Mathematica's Param3D

   slices3d      Uses tkrplot to create an interactive slice view of three or
                 four dimensional volume data, such as MRI data.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New CRAN package dyn
Message-ID: <971536df050608100869f5196d@mail.gmail.com>

dyn is an R package that facilitates the use of regression
using time series data with lags and diffs (known as dynamic
regression).  It is a lightweight package that has no
facilities of its own but leverages off the various time
series and regression functions in R to make it easier to
use them together.

Its features include:

- many regression functions.  It can be used with lm, glm,
  loess, rq, randomForest, lqs, rlm and any other regression 
  functions that use model.frame and are written in the
  style of lm.

- many time series classes. It can be used with ts, zooreg,
  zoo, its, and irts time series classes.  This covers
  regular, weakly regular and irregular time series classes.

- missing values.  Time series may have missing values including
  internal missing values.  Both na.omit and na.exclude are
  supported.  

- good citizen.  It does not replace the regression
  functions but rather works with them by providing new
  methods to the standard R generics: model.frame, resid,
  fitted, predict, update, anova and $.

- ease of use.  dyn enables one to use the same regression
  functions (lm, glm, etc.) using the same syntax one has
  always used.  Just preface the regression function name with 
  dyn$ and it is transformed into a regression function that 
  can handle time series:

   dyn$lm( y ~ x + lag(x) + diff(w) )     # lm
   dyn$loess( y ~ x + lag(x) + diff(w) )  # loess

- modular.  dyn can be used with any regression function that
  uses model.frame and is written in the style of lm.  Additional
  classes can be added to dyn simply by adding new methods. dyn
  is modular so such updates can be made without changing dyn, 
  itself. 

- documentation.  It includes a help page and six demos.

   ?dyn           # help file
   demo()         # look under dyn for list of demos
   demo("dyn-rq") # runs indicated dyn demo

The package is available on CRAN.  Comments/questions welcome.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New versions of Matrix and lme4 packages
Message-ID: <40e66e0b050610121126020323@mail.gmail.com>

I have uploaded version 0.96-1 of both Matrix and lme4 to CRAN.  The
source package should migrate to CRAN over the weekend and binary
packages should be available some time next week.

As for previous releases, the versions of these two packages are
interdependent.  The lme4 package requires Matrix_0.96-1 or later but
we cannot enforce the other dependency.  Please remember that if you
upgrade the Matrix package you should also upgrade the lme4 package.

The method for fitting generalized linear mixed models using the
Laplacian approximation is considerably faster in this version.  Also,
the packages have been reorganized so the interdependence will not be
as strong in the future.

Subject: [R-pkgs] New CRAN package sp: classes and methods for spatial data
Message-ID: <42B2DC1F.7090901@geog.uu.nl>

We're happy to announce the CRAN release of "sp", an R package which
has new-style classes and methods for spatial data, version 0.7-9.

Spatial data types that sp implements are: points, grids, lines, and
polygons (i.e., rings) optionally with holes. Methods include

+ the usual print, summary, plot, [, [[, $, ...
+ coercion between types (e.g. points and grids, matrices, data.frames)
+ coordinates(x), which returns the spatial coordinates of x
+ bbox(x), returns the coordinates bounding box of x
+ overlay, to query the value of e.g. points in polygons or grid
   (essentially does a point-in-polygon or point-in-raster cell)
+ spsample, for random sampling methods over a spatial domain.

An additional package (spproj) provides coordinate reference system
transformation (projection and re-projection) using the PROJ.4 library
[2]. Others (will) provide interfaces to GRASS 6 and gdal.

A good deal of work has also gone into providing plotting methods using
base, grid and lattice graphics, through the spplot function, a front-end
to lattice plots for spatial data (see gallery [1]).

The home page of these packages is found at
http://r-spatial.sourceforge.net/
See also the Task View on Spatial Data Analysis, linked from CRAN.

The reason why we wrote this package is that we think R is an excellent
environment to deal with spatial data, but that it lacks a uniform way
to deal with spatial data. Compared to the handling of dates and times,
which can utilize base classes or those provided in the chron package,
spatial data handling is much more fragmented. As a consequence:

- various packages make their own assumptions about how spatial data
   are organized
- spatial data organized for a certain package cannot easily be used
   for another package
- few (or no) packages address the full range of spatial data types
   (points, grids, lines, polygons) and their interaction
- generic spatial functionality (e.g. I/O to GIS, plotting, projection)
   is scattered and often limited in functionality.

It also means that many different package authors have to use time writing
similar data handling code, rather than concentrating on analytical
functions. If the sp package achieves its goals, data I/O will become
many-to-one, and data access for analysis one-to-many, providing a shared
data object layer for which shared methods can be written.

Classes and methods for spatial data are only useful when the spatial
packages support them. The sp development team includes maintainers of
a number of spatial R packages, on which we will work, and we hope that
over time other spatial package maintainers will also provide support
for the classes provided by this package.

Although we are working towards a fixed set of classes at this moment
of the development of sp we cannot fully guarantee that the exact
representation of the sp classes will not change in the future. Therefore,
we advise users to keep the scripts with instructions of building the
data into sp classes; it is most likely that we will not change the
building functions and methods.

Work in progress currently involves:
- support of sp classes by several spatial statistics packages
- automatic determination of hole polygons from shapefiles
- plotting filled polygons with holes
- gdal read/write support
- GRASS 6.0 support

The development of this package is a joint effort of Virgilio Gomez-Rubio,
Barry Rowlinson, Roger Bivand and Edzer Pebesma, and followed from
discussions held at a pre-DSC2003 workshop [3], announcements on R-sig-geo
[4], and a meeting held last November in Lancaster [5]. A beta release
of sp was announced a while ago on R-sig-geo [6].

With best regards,

Message-ID: <33577.136.177.22.105.1119474519.squirrel@webmail.fpcc.net>

The R interface to the GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) is now available
on CRAN.

The R interface functions are almost identical to the native GLPK C API
making it easy to move code and concepts between R and C.

The GLPK package is intended for solving large-scale linear programming
(LP), mixed integer linear programming (MIP), and other related problems.

The GLPK library includes the following main components:

* implementation of the simplex method;
* implementation of the primal-dual interior-point method;
* implementation of the branch-and-bound method;
* application program interface (API);
* GNU MathProg modeling language (a subset of AMPL);
* GLPSOL, a stand-alone LP/MIP solver.

See GLPK webpage <http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html>.

Dear useRs,

a new package for tree-structured regression is available on CRAN.

This package implements a unified framework for recursive partitioning
which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined
theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on
multiple test procedures are implemented. The methodology is applicable
to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric,
censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary
measurement scales of the covariates. Extensible functionality for
visualizing tree-structured regression models is available.

Best,

Torsten

Subject: [R-pkgs] New version of "vcd" package
Message-ID: <20050705003039.563e6e9c.david.meyer@wu-wien.ac.at>

Dear useRs,

a completely revised version of the `vcd' ("Visualizing Categorical
Data") package is now
available from CRAN. This major revision includes the following
enhancements:

* grid-based:

The package is now entirely based on `grid', the new R graphics system,
thus exploiting
its unique functionalities. Powered by grid, it is now possible,
e.g., to simply compose complex plots of available components, or to
modify plot elements 
after they have been drawn.

* new flexible framework for mosaic and association plots

Extended mosaic and association plots are now integrated in a completely
new
generic framework for the visualization of contingency tables (so-called
`strucplots'). 
The new design modularizes labeling, shading, spacing, and drawing of
legends, and
also the cells' content by the use of panel functions.

Powerful labeling functions offer much more flexibility for adding
labels
(e.g., no restrictions on the number of dimensions, flexible positioning
of labels,
cell labeling, etc.)

The framework in particular includes many predefinded functions for the
creation of
residual-based shadings.

Convenience interfaces for various `flavors' of mosaic displays are
available, e.g., 
doubledecker plots, or visualizations of "loglm" objects with
residual-based shading.

* misc:

In addition, the package features several new data sets, and an
inference
function for (conditional) independence of margins in a contingency
table.


Happy drawing!

David, Achim, Kurt

batchfiles, available on CRAN at

   http://cran.r-project.org/contrib/extra/batchfiles/

consists of a set of Windows XP batch files (they may run on 
NT/2000 too but that has not been tested) which facilitate:

1. starting R, automatically locating it in the registry
   each time they are run, so that when a new version of 
   R is installed its not necessary to update them all 
   - Rcmd.bat, Rgui.bat, R.bat

2. copying configuration files to new versions of R when R
   is updated and optionally updating MiKTeX to be consistent 
   with a new R version.  After a one-time configuration just 
   run the batch file after each new download and install of R 
   - Rrefresh.bat

3. use of .Rbuildignore when checking and installing 
   R packages automatically running a build first and then 
   'Rcmd CHECK' or 'Rcmd INSTALL' in one step.  Also sets R_LIBS
   to .../R/library if R_LIBS has not already been set.
   - makepkgs.bat

4. locating various R tools that are used in building R packages
   on your system by querying the registry.
   - Rfind.bat

Comments welcome.

Subject: [R-pkgs] tseriesChaos ver. 0.1
Message-ID: <1122130908.8703.6.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Dear all,

I have uploaded to CRAN a new package: tseriesChaos.
This is an early version (0.1) with basic tools for the explorative
analysis of nonlinear time series motivated by chaos theory. Until now,
the package is largely inspired by the TISEAN project (by Rainer Hegger,
Holger Kantz and Thomas Schreiber:
http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~tisean/ ).

This version includes:
- Method of false nearest neighbours for the choice of the embedding
dimension.
- Tools for the estimation of the correlation dimension.
- Kantz algorithm for the estimation of the largest Lyapunov exponent.
- (naif) mutual information index estimation.
- Space-time separation plot.
- Recurrence plot.
- Simulation of noise-free continuous dynamic systems.

At the present time, algorithms are not too much optimized for speed, we
are working on optimizing the codes.
Future versions will (hopefully) include also code inspired from the
book of Chan and Tong (2001) (Chaos: A Statistical perspective) by
Springer as well as other contributions.
Checking was mainly done by comparing results with those available in
literature.
Any kind of feedback/help would be greatly appreciated.

Antonio, Fabio Di Narzo.

Subject: [R-pkgs] [ANNOUNCE] mod_R: The R/Apache Integration Project
Message-ID: <42EF26AD.2050208@vanderbilt.edu>


   What is it?
   -----------
   mod_R is a project dedicated to embedding the R interpreter inside
   the Apache 2.0 (and beyond) web server for the purpose of writing web
   applications in R. It's composed of three parts:

   mod_R: the Apache 2.0 module that implements the glue to load the
   R interpreter.

   RApache: the R package that provides the API for programming web
   applications in R.

   libapreq 2.0.4: an Apache sponsored project for parsing request input.
   If you don't want to compile and install this version, then you can
   specify which libapreq2 library to use during configuration.

   The Latest Version
   ------------------

   Details of the latest version can be found at the mod_R
   project page:

http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/ApacheRproject

   (mind the wrap)


   Prerequisites
   -------------
   This release has been tested under Debian Linux with Apache 2.0.54,
   R 2.1.1, and libapreq 2.0.4.  Apache2 _MUST_ be compiled with the
   prefork MPM to compile mod_R. Also, R must have been compiled with
   the --enable-R-shlib configure flag.

   Installation
   ------------
   The following is the preferred way to compile and install mod_R:

     $ ./configure --with-apache2-apxs=/path/to/apxs --with-R=/path/to/R
     $ make
     $ make install

   Both --with-apache2-apxs and --with-R _MUST_ be specified.  Otherwise,
   trying to figure out the dependencies between the sources and headers
   and library paths becomes quite complex.

   If you don't want to compile and install the bundled libapreq2 version,
   then add --with-apreq2-config=/path/to/apreq2-config. The version _MUST_
   be equal to or greater than 2.0.4.

   Configuration
   -------------
   In order to use mod_R and RApache, you must configure apache to find
   it. Type help("directives",package="RApache") once mod_R is installed
   for a little more detail. Add something similar to this to the apache
   config file:

     LoadModule R_Module /path/to/mod_R.so

     <Location /URL>
        SetHandler r-handler
        Rsource /path/to/R/code.R
        RreqHandler function-name
        Rlibrary library-name
     </Location>

   Also, libR.so _MUST_ be found in the shared library path as it is
   linked to by mod_R, RApache and the rest of the packages containing
   shared libraries. You can either set LD_LIBRARY_PATH like this:

      $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`/path/to/R RHOME`/lib

   or add that path to /etc/ld.so.conf and then run ldconfig.

   NOTE: the latest apache2 debian packages cause the web server to run
   in a very reduced environment, thus one is unable to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   before calling /etc/init.d/apache2. One option is to actually edit that
   file and add the LD_LIBRARY_PATH explicitly. Another is to use the 
apache2ctl
   scripts which are also bundled with the debian packages. Or you can 
add it
   to /etc/ld.so.conf.

   Documentation
   -------------
   All of the documentation is currently in the RApache package. Once
   you install mod_R, start R and load the RApache package. You'll get
   a warning that you're currently not running the R interpreter within
   Apache; just don't try to run any of the code. Sample session:
    > library(RApache)
    Warning message:

    RApache is only useful within the Apache web server.
    It is loaded now for informational purposes only

     in: firstlib(which.lib.loc, package)
    > help(package="RApache")

Message-ID: <200508052023.31632.deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>


[This is more a warning than an announcement]

A new version of lattice should be soon on CRAN. From this version onwards, 
all high-level lattice functions are (S3) generic. All of them have formula 
methods, some have other methods as well, formalizing the various non-formula 
uses which used to be handled by clumsy hacks in the past. There's also a new 
table method for barchart.

Ideally, this change should be completely transparent to the user and no 
existing code should break (except undocumented and inappropriate examples 
like 

dotplot( x  | a )

which used to work like dotplot(~x | a) before). However, Murphy's law usually 
prevails, so...

Message-ID: <14ce7bc2a2d0dd85e6b9e92332b528ec@uni-goettingen.de>

RGL Version 0.65 [r405 / 2005-08-14]

DESCRIPTION
The RGL package is a visualization device system for R, using
OpenGL as the rendering backend. An rgl device at its core
is a real-time 3D engine written in C++. It provides an
interactive viewpoint navigation facility (mouse + wheel support)
and an R programming interface.

RELEASE INFO
This is a Beta release. We target a stable release at the end of 
September 2005.

WHATS NEW
* A native Mac OS X / Carbon version is shipped with this release.
   No need to start an X11 Server.
   The X11 Port is still available, but configure defaults to use Carbon.

* The X11 port has been improved. The crash (using rgl.close() or 
rgl.quit()
   has been fixed.

* User-selectable mouse handlers featuring trackball navigation and
   interactive selection.

* A new interface concept "R3D" is available for preview and discussion
   using the function name pattern:
     XXX3d()

   The functions map to rgl functions internally (with some exceptions).

   Here's a short list of interesting spots in the interface API:

   * par3d() can be used to get/set values on the current RGL device.

   * Primitives functions such as points3d(), lines3d(), surface3d(), ...

   * First bunch of generic transformation utilities, rendering methods
     and mesh objects are implemented.

   The rgl interface using the pattern "rgl.XXX()" is still available.
   You can decide between more OpenGL/RGL'is low-level functions or
   more R'ish functions using the R3D interface concept.

* Rendering of blended surfaces using hierarchical z-sorting.

* New material property: Texture environment mapping

Subject: [R-pkgs] For2R - Interface from Fortran to R
Message-ID: <430B8250.9060308@noaa.gov>

We announce the availability of the Fortran 95 module "For2R", which 
makes it easy to write complicated R data structures (i.e., lists of 
lists, matrices, dataframes, ...) from Fortran programs. By a series of 
subroutine calls, program outputs can be written to a file readable by R 
with a single "dget" function call. This facilitates automated graphics 
generation and other postprocessing of model results.

A downloadable ZIP file of For2R is available from  
http://shrimp.ccfhrb.noaa.gov/~mprager/Rinter.html  and includes Fortran 
source, documentation, and an example.

We are working on similar code to interface C++ with R. An extremely 
crude version of such code is available from the same page. Though the 
C++ code will be totally replaced, the download includes sample output 
and R graphics functions for automated processing of a fisheries example. 

Although For2R is much nicer than our current C++ code, it should all be 
considered beta-test code, and it is supplied with no warranty 
whatsoever.  Bug reports and suggestions are welcome.

Dear R-users,

We'd like to announce the release of our new package "grouped" 
(available from CRAN), for fitting models for grouped or coarse data, 
under the Coarsened At Random assumption. This is useful in cases 
where the true response variable is known only up to an interval in 
which it lies. Features of the package include: power calculations for 
two-group comparisons, computation of Bayesian residuals using 
Multiple Imputation, capability of fitting models for index-kind data 
(e.g., quality of life indexes). Any kind of feedback (questions, 
suggestions, bug-reports, etc.) is more than welcome.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0509072038490.7066-100000@reclus.nhh.no>

Revised versions of maptools, a package for reading geographical data from

handling, have been released on CRAN. They are maptools release 0.5-1 and
sp release 0.8-1.

The maptools package now depends on sp (>= 0.8), so that users of maptools
will need both to update the package itself, and to install the sp
package. All previous maptools classes and functions are still available,
but users are encouraged to try out the cleaner and more robust versions
in sp.

Further details of changes (particularly incompatible changes in sp) are
available on the R-sig-geo mailing list (see the "Spatial" task view on
CRAN), and at http://r-spatial.sourceforge.net

Dear R-packages list members,

I've recently uploaded to CRAN version 1.1-1 of the Rcmdr ("R Commander")
package. Based on the tcltk package, the Rcmdr provides a basic-statistics
graphical interface to R.

The general functionality of the R Commander has not changed much since
version 1.0-0. There are some small improvements to the package, but the
reason that I'm re-announcing it is that the latest version supports
translation into other languages, using the new internationalization and
localization features of R 2.1.x. 

A Catalan translation (courtesy of Manel Salamero), a French translation
(courtesy of Philippe Grosjean), a Japanese translations (courtesy of
Takaharu Araki), and a Slovenian translation (courtesy of Jaro Lajovic), are
provided with the Rcmdr package. I understand that Portuguese, Russian, and
Spanish translations are in the works, and these will be incorporated when
they are completed. 

If you're interested in translating the Rcmdr into another language, please
contact me.

As before, bug reports, suggestions, and other feedback are appreciated.

Announcement of a major revision of package tuneR

The package tuneR for the analysis of sound has been updated, improved,
and extended.
Most notably the functionality of the orphaned package
"sound" has been merged into tuneR. Because tuneR's representation and
API is very different, it was not possible to retain the "API" (i.e.
names of functions, argument ordering and expected objects) of package
"sound".

Subject: [R-pkgs] Reshape package: new version 0.5
Message-ID: <f8e6ff05050922163639f6d954@mail.gmail.com>

Reshape version 0.5
===================

Reshape is an R package for flexibly restructuring and aggregating
data.  It's very much pivot table inspired, and it (hopefully) makes
it very easy to view your data the way you want.  You can find out
more at http://had.co.nz/reshape

The big news in this version of reshape is that I've renamed all the
functions so they no longer conflict with any built in functions -
deshape is now melt (think liquid data) and reshape is now cast (think
solidifying data into the form you want).

What else is new?

 * recast melts and casts your data in one step
 * column naming bugs fixed
 * easily display all margins with the argument margins=T in cast

Please let me know what you think.

Regards,

Hadley

Message-ID: <00cd01c5c341$50444870$0540210a@www.domain>

Dear R users,

I'd like to announce the new version of the package "ltm" (available 
from CRAN), for fitting Latent Trait Models (including the Rasch and 
two-parameter logistic models) under the Item Response Theory 
approach. Three main extra features have been added: (i) now both 
ltm() and rasch() permit general fixed-value constraints (e.g., useful 
for scaling purposes), (ii) there is the option to report the 
estimated parameters under the usual IRT parameterization, and (iii) 
both plot.ltm() and plot.rasch() are now more flexible. For info about 
other new features check the help and CHANGES files. Future plans 
include development of functions for fitting the three-parameter 
logistic and the graded response models. Any kind of feedback 
(questions, suggestions, bug-reports, etc.) is more than welcome.

Best,
Dimitris

Version 1.1-0 of the pls package is now available on CRAN.

The pls package implements partial least squares regression (PLSR) and
principal component regression (PCR).  Features of the package include

- Several plsr algorithms: orthogonal scores, kernel pls and simpls
- Flexible cross-validation
- A formula interface, with traditional methods like predict, coef,
  plot and summary
- Functions for extraction of scores and loadings, and calculation of
  (R)MSEP and R2
- A simple multiplicative scatter correction (msc) implementation
- Functions for plotting predictions, validation statistics,
  coefficients, scores, loadings, biplots and correlation loadings.

The main changes since 1.0-3 are

- mvr, mvrCv and predict.mvr now has builtin support for scaling of X.
- A new function stdize for explicit centering and/or scaling.
- Correlation loadings plot (corrplot).
- New argument `varnames' in coefplot, to label the x tick marks with the
  variable names.
- loadingplot, coefplot and plot.mvrVal can now display legends, with the
  argument 'legendpos'.

Dear useRs,

a new version of the vcd package (0.9-5) is now available from CRAN.

Apart from (a lot of) bug fixes, it includes the following new features
(some of them have 'silently' been included in previous bug fix
releases):

* Improved documentation:

  - an introductory vignette on the strucplot framework (including
    mosaic, association and sieve plots)
  - special vignettes on using/extending shading and labeling functions

* New function spine() for spinograms and spine plots

* New function cd_plot() for conditional density plots 

* New function cotabplot() for visualizing conditional independence in a
  trellis-like layout, providing panel functions for association,
  mosaic, and sieve plots

* Sieve plots are now integrated in the strucplot framework, sieve()
  replaces sieveplot()

* Extended support for 'structable' objects (textual representation of
  mosaic plots):

  - structable objects can be used as input for mosaic(), sieve(), and
    assoc()
  - extract ("[") and replacement ("[<-") functions are available (old
    "[[" method removed)
  - methods for t(), dim(), as.matrix(), as.vector(), as.table(), etc.
    are available

* New panel function pairs_diagonal_text() for pairs()

* The alternative legend function legend_fixed() now looks more similar
  to the legend of mosaicplot() in base R

Comments are more then welcome!

David, Achim, Kurt.

PS: If you like modern art, try out demo(mondrian)! :)

Date: Sat, 22 Oct 2005 21:23:26 +0200
Subject: [R-pkgs] after package reorganization: version 1.6 of package
 "distr" available;
 new packages "distrEx", "distrSim", "distrTEst", "RandVar"
Message-ID: <435A91AE.4020109@uni-bayreuth.de>

After some reorganization, we would like to announce the availability
on CRAN of a new version (1.6) of our package "distr" as well as the
availabilty on CRAN of the new packages "distrEx", "distrSim",
"distrTEst", "RandVar".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from 1.5 to 1.6
-[former package "distr"] reorganization:
 we have split up our package distr into smaller units:
 * "distr" now only contains the (basic) classes and methods
           for distributions
 * "distrSim" requires "distr" and contains classes and methods
           for data / simulations formerly contained in "distr"
 * "distrTEst" requires "distr" and "distrSim" and contains
           classes and methods for evaluation of estimators
           at data / simulations formerly contained in "distr"
-[distrSim] under the hood: signature of method "simulate" adapted
            in order to prevent collision with corresponding method
            from the stats package
some more details to be found at
http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/departments/math/org/mathe7/DISTR
a more detailed manual is available at
http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/departments/math/org/mathe7/DISTR/distr.pdf

-additional packages by Matthias Kohl:
 * "distrEx" requires "distr" and contains some extensions to
           package "distr" (see later)
 * "RandVar" requires "distr" and "distrEx" and contains classes
           and methods for random variables (see later)
These two packages are described in some detail in Matthias' PhD Thesis
"Numerical Contributions to the Asymptotic Theory of Robustness", App. D
available on http://stamats.de/ThesisMKohl.pdf

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Descriptions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Description of "distr":
"distr" is to provide a conceptual treatment of random variables
(r.v.'s) by means of S4--classes. A virtual mother class "Distribution"
is introduced.
All distributions of the "base" package are implemented as subclasses of
either "AbscontDistribution" or "DiscreteDistribution".

Using these classes, we also provide (default) methods to automatically
generate the image distributions under unary mathematical operations as
well as a general convolution algorithm.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Description of "distrSim":
Classes and methods are provided for a standardized treatment of
simulations (also under contaminations) .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Description of "distrTEst":
Classes and methods are provided for a standardized treatment of
the evaluation of statistical procedures (up to now only estimators)
at data/simulations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Description of "distrEx":
This package provides some extensions to package "distr"
like:
* extreme value distribution classes,
*expectations
  +in the form E(X)  for the expectation of X where X is some
    distribution or
  +in the form E(X,f) for the expectation of f(X) where X is
     some distribution and f some function in X,
* truncated moments,
* distances between distributions
  (Hellinger, Kolmogorov, total variation, "convex contamination")
* lists of distributions,
* conditional distributions in factorized form 
* conditional expectations in factorized form
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Description of "RandVar":
This package introduces classes and methods for random
variables (understood as measurable mappings); in particular
groups Math and Arith as well as matrix multiplication  and
expectations are available so that quite general "regular" expressions
with random variables are possible.

We look forward to receiving questions, comments and suggestions

Subject: [R-pkgs] New version of RQuantLib
Message-ID: <17253.35715.443094.418346@basebud.nulle.part>


A new version of RQuantLib has been uploaded to CRAN a few days ago (and
should be available at http://cran.r-project.org and all mirrors). Debian
binaries are also available.

Among the new features in version 0.2.0, all of which are due to excellent
contributions by Dominick Samperi, are
- new functions for Fixed Income support:
   * DiscountCurve for discount / forward / zero curve construction
   * BermudanSwaption provding several QuantLib pricers for Swaptions
- new internal R / C++ interface class RCpp
- Windows binary packages on CRAN 

Windows users can now install RQuantLib via the menu just like any other
package.  Debian users can still say 'apt-get install r-cran-rquantlib'. All
others can compile manually (which still requires Boost and QuantLib
headers).

We also have an experimental OpenGL demo of option analytics visualisation
via the rgl package.  However, there are some concerns over stability,
especially on platforms with ATI graphics card.  If you want to try it, do
 
> library(RQuantLib)
> source(url("http://basebud.nulle.part/~edd/code/rquantlib/OptionSurfaces.R"))

and let us know how it worked (or not) and what your platform is. We still
would like to release this in an upcoming revision.  A more fail-safe way,
using animated gifs of the demo's output, is available at

     http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rquantlib-rgl.html

Special thanks to Dominick Sapieri for the new code and all his testing and
building help, and to Uwe Ligges for help with the Windows binaries.

With best regards, Dirk

Message-ID: <2E1DE912-9603-4733-B00E-7450335F65E9@stanford.edu>

We have uploaded to CRAN the first version of glmpath,
which fits the L1 regularization path for generalized linear models.

The lars package fits the entire piecewise-linear L1 regularization  
path for
the lasso. The coefficient paths for L1 regularized glms, however,   
are not piecewise linear.
glmpath uses convex optimization - in particular predictor-corrector  
methods-
to fit the coefficient path at important junctions. These junctions  
are at the "knots" in |beta|
where variables enter/leave the active set; i.e.  nonzero/zero values.
Users can request greater resolution at a cost of more computation,  
and compute values
on a fine grid between the knots.

The code is fast, and can handle largish problems efficiently.
it took just over 4 sec system cpu time to fit the logistic  
regression path for
the "spam" data from UCI with 3065 training obs and 57 predictors.
For a microarray example with 5000 variables and 100 observations, 11  
seconds cpu time.

Currently glmpath implements binomial, poisson and gaussian families.

Brief description of changes:

CHANGES IN GDATA 2.1.2
-----------------------

 - Fixed bug in interleave.R - option to covert 1-column matrices to
   vector (based on Andrew Burgess's suggestion)

 - Updated Greg and Jim's email adresses

 - ll.R: Suppressed warning message in attach() call.

 - frameApply.Rd, reorder.Rd: Remove explicit loading of
   gtools in examples, so that failure to import functions from
   gtools gets properly caught by running the examples.

 - upperTriangle.R, man/upperTriangle.Rd: Add functions for
   extracting and modifying the upper and lower trianglular components of
   matrices.

 - is.what.R: Replaced the "not.using" vector with a more robust
   try(get(test)) to find out whether a particular is.* function
   returns a logical of length one.

-  DESCRIPTION: Added Suggests field

 -  Updated the example in frameApply

CHANGES IN GMODELS 2.12.0
-------------------------

- Updated Greg's email address.

- Add support for lmer (lme version 4) objects to ci(), estimable(),
  and fit.contrast() via code contributed by Randall C Johnson.

- Add simplfied coefficient specification to estimable() based on a
  function provided by Randall C Johnson.  It is now possible to do
  things like:
        estimable(reg, c("xB"=1,"xD"=-1))
  instead of:
        estimable(reg, c(    0,   1,     0,   -1))
  which should make estimable() much easier to use for large models.

CHANGES IN GPLOTS 2.2.0
-----------------------

 - plotmeans.R: Fixed bug in plotmeans - based on Stefano Calza's
                suggestion (the function didn't account for factors
                unused levels, returning an error.)

 - exported plot.lm to NAMESPACE, Remove .Alias calls in plot.lm.R
                since .Alias is defunct.

 - barplot2.R: Changed the default greay colors to heat colors, if
               height is matrix

 - Updated Greg's email address

 - balloonplot.R: Recent changes to align row totals with the
                  overall total broke how the marginal cumulative
                  fractions were displayed. Added example using
                  Titanic data that exercises the multi-factor display.
                  Added -.tex, .pdf files and figuers, and RNEWS article
                  in inst/doc

 - colorpanel.R: colorpanel now allows only 2 colors to be specified
                 if no 'middle' color is desired.

CHANGES IN gtools 2.2.2
-----------------------

 -  src/setTCPNoDelay.c: Add C source code for setTCPNoDelay.

 -  NAMESPACE: Add UseDynLib to NAMESPACE so the shared library gets
               properly loaded.

 - Updated Greg's email address.

  - New function 'addLast' that adds functions to R's .Last() so
    that they will be executed when R is terminating.

  - New function setTCPNoDelay() that allows the TCP_NODELAY flag to
    be changed on socket objects.

Executive Summary: 

    Quantian 0.7.9.1 is the first Quantian release based on Knoppix 4.0.2.
    Quantian adds hundreds of scientific / numeric packages, as well as the
    openMosix enabled 2.4.27 kernel, to the cdrom version of Knoppix. 
    
    Relative to the previous release 0.6.9.3, hundreds of applications have
    been updated, and many new applications (such as polyxmass, scigraphica,
    kst, octaviz, gromacs) have been added. Quantian now contains over 2400
    Debian packages, and over 800 packages for R.

    Quantian comes as one bootable dvd iso of 2.5gb (compressed) with
    almost 7 gb (uncompressed) of software of interest to quantitative 
    analysts, scientists, researchers or students.


Announcing Quantian release 0.7.9.1
===================================


I   What is it?

    Quantian is a remastering of Knoppix, the self-configuring and directly
    bootable cdrom/dvd that turns any pc or laptop into a full-featured Linux
    workstation, and (parts of) clusterKnoppix, which adds support for
    openMosix-based  cluster computing. However, Quantian differs from
    Knoppix by having a particular focus on quantitative, numerical or 
    scientific applications, and hence adds a very large set of programs of
    interest to applied or theoretical workers in quantitative or data-driven
    fields to the solid base provided by Knoppix.

    See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian.html for more details.

    
II What Quantian highlights should I care about ?

    o First release based on Knoppix 4.0.2: Derived from the cdrom version of
      Knoppix, Quantian utilises the unionfs setup of Knoppix to combine two
      compressed loop images for a total of 2.5 gb (from two files of 2.0 gb
      and 425 mb) corresponding to almost 7 gb of software.

    o KDE 3.4, Kernel 2.6.12; added backport of kernel 2.4.27 with openMosix
      patch for continued openMosix support [ but note that openMosix and
      unionfs seem to conflict so kernel 2.4.27 only sees the first
      compressed loop image ]

    o Some highlights in 0.7.9.1 are
      
      - very complete R support with over 800 packages (28 from 'core R',
        another 70 from Debian packages, and 724 directly installed from
        CRAN and BioConductor, covering over 99% of all packages at CRAN
        and BioConductor [ not counting a handful of windows-only CRAN
        packages ] ), ESS editing in Emacs/XEmacs, GGobi visualization, 
        Rpad webinterface, and initial support for the RKward GUI;

      - even stronger bioinformatics/biology support than before:
        BioConductor, arb, biofox, bioperl, biopython, blast2, boxshade,
        bugsx, clustalw, fastdnaml, fastlink, garlic, gromacs, hmmer, loki,
        mipe, molphy, muscle, ncbi, phylip, rasmol, readseq, seaview,
        t-coffee, textopo, and more;

      - continued strong mathematics / computational algrebra support: axiom,
        blacs, calc, euler, gap, giac, mathomatic, maxima, pari, scalapack,
        scilab, texmacs, yacas, yorick;

      - strong visualization / graphics support: dx, garlic, gdpc, gnuplot,
        grace, grass, gri, illuminator, kst, labplot, mayavi, matplot, proj,
        plplot, plotmtv, rasmol, starplot, vtk, xd3d, xgraph, ygraph; 
 
      - large number of programming and scripting languages, editors, 
        debuggers and libraries;

      - excellent latex support with auctex, lyx, kile, texmacs interface,
        as well as numerous macro packages, bibtex tools;

      - office support via openoffice and koffice suites, abiword, gnumeric
        and other applications;

      - plus all the tools and toys from the current Knoppix relase.

    o See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/changelog.html for details.

    o See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/howto.html for several
      short HOWTOs on booting Quantian from hd on either Windows or Linux,
      booting via a bootcd (such as clusterKnoppix), or botting from a 
      USB memory device.  Contributions, corrections, and feedback on these
      HOWTOs is always appreciated.


III Where do I get it?

    o Downloads are available from the main host at Seattle at FHCRC:

            http://quantian.fhcrc.org/
	    rsync://quantian.fhcrc.org/quantian/
      
      and at the East Coast at 

            http://research.warnes.net/downloads/quantian/CURRENT/
	    ftp://research.warnes.net/users/edd/quantian/CURRENT/

      The most recent release is also available at

            http://quantian.alioth.debian.org/

      Note that file size of 2.5 gb may upset web caching system such
      as squid. It may be best to rely on rsync or bittorrent instead
      of http.

    o Bittorrents should be available shortly at

            http://www.tlm-project.org/public/distributions/quantian/

    o The main European mirrors should catch up shortly:

            http://sunsite.rediris.es/mirror/quantian

            http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/ftp/pub/Linux/quantian

    o CD/DVD vendors will probably update their offerings soon as well. 
      See the Quantian site for a list.


IV  Mailing lists

    o Two mailing lists exist for Quantian

        quantian-announce	  for announcements, intended to be low volume
        quantian-general	  for general discussions about Quantian

      available via

	http://alioth.debian.org/mail/?group_id=30303

      for subscription info etc., and start using the quantian-general lists
      for general questions, comments, suggestions or discussions about 
      Quantian.

      Quantian-general is subscribed to quantian-announce, so you only need
      to subscribe to one (but can of course subscribe to both).  Posting to
      quantian-general requires a subscription. 

      Reply-To: for this message is quantian-general at lists.alioth.debian.org
      so that discussions can be continued on the list.


V  Known Bugs in 0.7.9.1

    o Debian's current C++ transition affects the KDE packages. Several 
      packages had to be installed from the stable relase, and a few
      (celestia, gdal) are currently uninstallable. This should should
      improve over the next few weeks/months.
     
    o Kdvi is broken. However, xdvi works as do the various pdf previewers
      so (PDF)LaTeX use is still possible.

    o As noticed above, when openMosix and kernel 2.4.27 are used, the
      second compressed loop image is not accessible implying that the 
      /opt, /usr/games, /usr/lib/j2se, /usr/share/doc, /usr/src, /usr/NX
      directories are not accessible.


VI   Other items

    o Feedback / poll on package additions or removal

      As always, I welcome comments and suggestions about programs to be
      added or removed. Existing Debian packages, and possibly existing
      rpm packages, typically get inserted quite readily.

      Please send feedback, questions, comments, ... to the 
      
	quantian-general at lists.alioth.debian.org

      list to maximise the number of eyes glancing at any one question.
      Notice that a subscription to the list is needed in order to post.

    o Feedback would also be appreciated on ways to better communicate with
      difference scientific communities that could be interested in Quantian.


VII Notes

    [1] This email is sent via the quantian-announce mailing list. I have
        subscribed those whose email addresses are in my quantian mail folder
        due to prior emails. The quantian-announce mailing list only sends
        moderator-approved posts -- so there should be no spam whatsoever.
        Anybody who considers this unwanted is kindly asked to send me a
        private mail to get unsubscribed immediately. Otherwise, replies and
        follow-ups should go to   
		quantian-general at lists.alioth.debian.org
	where posting may require an initial subscription.



Best regards,  Dirk
